CHAPTER 83
I. 84
Down 85
the 86
Rabbit-Hole 87
Alice 88
was 89
beginning 90
to 91
get 92
very 93
tired 94
of 95
sitting 96
by 97
her 98
sister 99
on 100
the 101
bank, 102
and 103
of 104
having 105
nothing 106
to 107
do: 108
once 109
or 110
twice 111
she 112
had 113
peeped 114
into 115
the 116
book 117
her 118
sister 119
was 120
reading, 121
but 122
it 123
had 124
no 125
pictures 126
or 127
conversations 128
in 129
it, 130
“and 131
what 132
is 133
the 134
use 135
of 136
a 137
book,” 138
thought 139
Alice 140
“without 141
pictures 142
or 143
conversations?” 144
So 145
she 146
was 147
considering 148
in 149
her 150
own 151
mind 152
(as 153
well 154
as 155
she 156
could, 157
for 158
the 159
hot 160
day 161
made 162
her 163
feel 164
very 165
sleepy 166
and 167
stupid), 168
whether 169
the 170
pleasure 171
of 172
making 173
a 174
daisy-chain 175
would 176
be 177
worth 178
the 179
trouble 180
of 181
getting 182
up 183
and 184
picking 185
the 186
daisies, 187
when 188
suddenly 189
a 190
White 191
Rabbit 192
with 193
pink 194
eyes 195
ran 196
close 197
by 198
her. 199
There 200
was 201
nothing 202
so 203
_very_ 204
remarkable 205
in 206
that; 207
nor 208
did 209
Alice 210
think 211
it 212
so 213
_very_ 214
much 215
out 216
of 217
the 218
way 219
to 220
hear 221
the 222
Rabbit 223
say 224
to 225
itself, 226
“Oh 227
dear! 228
Oh 229
dear! 230
I 231
shall 232
be 233
late!” 234
(when 235
she 236
thought 237
it 238
over 239
afterwards, 240
it 241
occurred 242
to 243
her 244
that 245
she 246
ought 247
to 248
have 249
wondered 250
at 251
this, 252
but 253
at 254
the 255
time 256
it 257
all 258
seemed 259
quite 260
natural); 261
but 262
when 263
the 264
Rabbit 265
actually 266
_took 267
a 268
watch 269
out 270
of 271
its 272
waistcoat-pocket_, 273
and 274
looked 275
at 276
it, 277
and 278
then 279
hurried 280
on, 281
Alice 282
started 283
to 284
her 285
feet, 286
for 287
it 288
flashed 289
across 290
her 291
mind 292
that 293
she 294
had 295
never 296
before 297
seen 298
a 299
rabbit 300
with 301
either 302
a 303
waistcoat-pocket, 304
or 305
a 306
watch 307
to 308
take 309
out 310
of 311
it, 312
and 313
burning 314
with 315
curiosity, 316
she 317
ran 318
across 319
the 320
field 321
after 322
it, 323
and 324
fortunately 325
was 326
just 327
in 328
time 329
to 330
see 331
it 332
pop 333
down 334
a 335
large 336
rabbit-hole 337
under 338
the 339
hedge. 340
In 341
another 342
moment 343
down 344
went 345
Alice 346
after 347
it, 348
never 349
once 350
considering 351
how 352
in 353
the 354
world 355
she 356
was 357
to 358
get 359
out 360
again. 361
The 362
rabbit-hole 363
went 364
straight 365
on 366
like 367
a 368
tunnel 369
for 370
some 371
way, 372
and 373
then 374
dipped 375
suddenly 376
down, 377
so 378
suddenly 379
that 380
Alice 381
had 382
not 383
a 384
moment 385
to 386
think 387
about 388
stopping 389
herself 390
before 391
she 392
found 393
herself 394
falling 395
down 396
a 397
very 398
deep 399
well. 400
Either 401
the 402
well 403
was 404
very 405
deep, 406
or 407
she 408
fell 409
very 410
slowly, 411
for 412
she 413
had 414
plenty 415
of 416
time 417
as 418
she 419
went 420
down 421
to 422
look 423
about 424
her 425
and 426
to 427
wonder 428
what 429
was 430
going 431
to 432
happen 433
next. 434
First, 435
she 436
tried 437
to 438
look 439
down 440
and 441
make 442
out 443
what 444
she 445
was 446
coming 447
to, 448
but 449
it 450
was 451
too 452
dark 453
to 454
see 455
anything; 456
then 457
she 458
looked 459
at 460
the 461
sides 462
of 463
the 464
well, 465
and 466
noticed 467
that 468
they 469
were 470
filled 471
with 472
cupboards 473
and 474
book-shelves; 475
here 476
and 477
there 478
she 479
saw 480
maps 481
and 482
pictures 483
hung 484
upon 485
pegs. 486
She 487
took 488
down 489
a 490
jar 491
from 492
one 493
of 494
the 495
shelves 496
as 497
she 498
passed; 499
it 500
was 501
labelled 502
“ORANGE 503
MARMALADE”, 504
but 505
to 506
her 507
great 508
disappointment 509
it 510
was 511
empty: 512
she 513
did 514
not 515
like 516
to 517
drop 518
the 519
jar 520
for 521
fear 522
of 523
killing 524
somebody 525
underneath, 526
so 527
managed 528
to 529
put 530
it 531
into 532
one 533
of 534
the 535
cupboards 536
as 537
she 538
fell 539
past 540
it. 541
“Well!” 542
thought 543
Alice 544
to 545
herself, 546
“after 547
such 548
a 549
fall 550
as 551
this, 552
I 553
shall 554
think 555
nothing 556
of 557
tumbling 558
down 559
stairs! 560
How 561
brave 562
they’ll 563
all 564
think 565
me 566
at 567
home! 568
Why, 569
I 570
wouldn’t 571
say 572
anything 573
about 574
it, 575
even 576
if 577
I 578
fell 579
off 580
the 581
top 582
of 583
the 584
house!” 585
(Which 586
was 587
very 588
likely 589
true.) 590
Down, 591
down, 592
down. 593
Would 594
the 595
fall 596
_never_ 597
come 598
to 599
an 600
end? 601
“I 602
wonder 603
how 604
many 605
miles 606
I’ve 607
fallen 608
by 609
this 610
time?” 611
she 612
said 613
aloud. 614
“I 615
must 616
be 617
getting 618
somewhere 619
near 620
the 621
centre 622
of 623
the 624
earth. 625
Let 626
me 627
see: 628
that 629
would 630
be 631
four 632
thousand 633
miles 634
down, 635
I 636
think—” 637
(for, 638
you 639
see, 640
Alice 641
had 642
learnt 643
several 644
things 645
of 646
this 647
sort 648
in 649
her 650
lessons 651
in 652
the 653
schoolroom, 654
and 655
though 656
this 657
was 658
not 659
a 660
_very_ 661
good 662
opportunity 663
for 664
showing 665
off 666
her 667
knowledge, 668
as 669
there 670
was 671
no 672
one 673
to 674
listen 675
to 676
her, 677
still 678
it 679
was 680
good 681
practice 682
to 683
say 684
it 685
over) 686
“—yes, 687
that’s 688
about 689
the 690
right 691
distance—but 692
then 693
I 694
wonder 695
what 696
Latitude 697
or 698
Longitude 699
I’ve 700
got 701
to?” 702
(Alice 703
had 704
no 705
idea 706
what 707
Latitude 708
was, 709
or 710
Longitude 711
either, 712
but 713
thought 714
they 715
were 716
nice 717
grand 718
words 719
to 720
say.) 721
Presently 722
she 723
began 724
again. 725
“I 726
wonder 727
if 728
I 729
shall 730
fall 731
right 732
_through_ 733
the 734
earth! 735
How 736
funny 737
it’ll 738
seem 739
to 740
come 741
out 742
among 743
the 744
people 745
that 746
walk 747
with 748
their 749
heads 750
downward! 751
The 752
Antipathies, 753
I 754
think—” 755
(she 756
was 757
rather 758
glad 759
there 760
_was_ 761
no 762
one 763
listening, 764
this 765
time, 766
as 767
it 768
didn’t 769
sound 770
at 771
all 772
the 773
right 774
word) 775
“—but 776
I 777
shall 778
have 779
to 780
ask 781
them 782
what 783
the 784
name 785
of 786
the 787
country 788
is, 789
you 790
know. 791
Please, 792
Ma’am, 793
is 794
this 795
New 796
Zealand 797
or 798
Australia?” 799
(and 800
she 801
tried 802
to 803
curtsey 804
as 805
she 806
spoke—fancy 807
_curtseying_ 808
as 809
you’re 810
falling 811
through 812
the 813
air! 814
Do 815
you 816
think 817
you 818
could 819
manage 820
it?) 821
“And 822
what 823
an 824
ignorant 825
little 826
girl 827
she’ll 828
think 829
me 830
for 831
asking! 832
No, 833
it’ll 834
never 835
do 836
to 837
ask: 838
perhaps 839
I 840
shall 841
see 842
it 843
written 844
up 845
somewhere.” 846
Down, 847
down, 848
down. 849
There 850
was 851
nothing 852
else 853
to 854
do, 855
so 856
Alice 857
soon 858
began 859
talking 860
again. 861
“Dinah’ll 862
miss 863
me 864
very 865
much 866
to-night, 867
I 868
should 869
think!” 870
(Dinah 871
was 872
the 873
cat.) 874
“I 875
hope 876
they’ll 877
remember 878
her 879
saucer 880
of 881
milk 882
at 883
tea-time. 884
Dinah 885
my 886
dear! 887
I 888
wish 889
you 890
were 891
down 892
here 893
with 894
me! 895
There 896
are 897
no 898
mice 899
in 900
the 901
air, 902
I’m 903
afraid, 904
but 905
you 906
might 907
catch 908
a 909
bat, 910
and 911
that’s 912
very 913
like 914
a 915
mouse, 916
you 917
know. 918
But 919
do 920
cats 921
eat 922
bats, 923
I 924
wonder?” 925
And 926
here 927
Alice 928
began 929
to 930
get 931
rather 932
sleepy, 933
and 934
went 935
on 936
saying 937
to 938
herself, 939
in 940
a 941
dreamy 942
sort 943
of 944
way, 945
“Do 946
cats 947
eat 948
bats? 949
Do 950
cats 951
eat 952
bats?” 953
and 954
sometimes, 955
“Do 956
bats 957
eat 958
cats?” 959
for, 960
you 961
see, 962
as 963
she 964
couldn’t 965
answer 966
either 967
question, 968
it 969
didn’t 970
much 971
matter 972
which 973
way 974
she 975
put 976
it. 977
She 978
felt 979
that 980
she 981
was 982
dozing 983
off, 984
and 985
had 986
just 987
begun 988
to 989
dream 990
that 991
she 992
was 993
walking 994
hand 995
in 996
hand 997
with 998
Dinah, 999
and 1000
saying 1001
to 1002
her 1003
very 1004
earnestly, 1005
“Now, 1006
Dinah, 1007
tell 1008
me 1009
the 1010
truth: 1011
did 1012
you 1013
ever 1014
eat 1015
a 1016
bat?” 1017
when 1018
suddenly, 1019
thump! 1020
thump! 1021
down 1022
she 1023
came 1024
upon 1025
a 1026
heap 1027
of 1028
sticks 1029
and 1030
dry 1031
leaves, 1032
and 1033
the 1034
fall 1035
was 1036
over. 1037
Alice 1038
was 1039
not 1040
a 1041
bit 1042
hurt, 1043
and 1044
she 1045
jumped 1046
up 1047
on 1048
to 1049
her 1050
feet 1051
in 1052
a 1053
moment: 1054
she 1055
looked 1056
up, 1057
but 1058
it 1059
was 1060
all 1061
dark 1062
overhead; 1063
before 1064
her 1065
was 1066
another 1067
long 1068
passage, 1069
and 1070
the 1071
White 1072
Rabbit 1073
was 1074
still 1075
in 1076
sight, 1077
hurrying 1078
down 1079
it. 1080
There 1081
was 1082
not 1083
a 1084
moment 1085
to 1086
be 1087
lost: 1088
away 1089
went 1090
Alice 1091
like 1092
the 1093
wind, 1094
and 1095
was 1096
just 1097
in 1098
time 1099
to 1100
hear 1101
it 1102
say, 1103
as 1104
it 1105
turned 1106
a 1107
corner, 1108
“Oh 1109
my 1110
ears 1111
and 1112
whiskers, 1113
how 1114
late 1115
it’s 1116
getting!” 1117
She 1118
was 1119
close 1120
behind 1121
it 1122
when 1123
she 1124
turned 1125
the 1126
corner, 1127
but 1128
the 1129
Rabbit 1130
was 1131
no 1132
longer 1133
to 1134
be 1135
seen: 1136
she 1137
found 1138
herself 1139
in 1140
a 1141
long, 1142
low 1143
hall, 1144
which 1145
was 1146
lit 1147
up 1148
by 1149
a 1150
row 1151
of 1152
lamps 1153
hanging 1154
from 1155
the 1156
roof. 1157
There 1158
were 1159
doors 1160
all 1161
round 1162
the 1163
hall, 1164
but 1165
they 1166
were 1167
all 1168
locked; 1169
and 1170
when 1171
Alice 1172
had 1173
been 1174
all 1175
the 1176
way 1177
down 1178
one 1179
side 1180
and 1181
up 1182
the 1183
other, 1184
trying 1185
every 1186
door, 1187
she 1188
walked 1189
sadly 1190
down 1191
the 1192
middle, 1193
wondering 1194
how 1195
she 1196
was 1197
ever 1198
to 1199
get 1200
out 1201
again. 1202
Suddenly 1203
she 1204
came 1205
upon 1206
a 1207
little 1208
three-legged 1209
table, 1210
all 1211
made 1212
of 1213
solid 1214
glass; 1215
there 1216
was 1217
nothing 1218
on 1219
it 1220
except 1221
a 1222
tiny 1223
golden 1224
key, 1225
and 1226
Alice’s 1227
first 1228
thought 1229
was 1230
that 1231
it 1232
might 1233
belong 1234
to 1235
one 1236
of 1237
the 1238
doors 1239
of 1240
the 1241
hall; 1242
but, 1243
alas! 1244
either 1245
the 1246
locks 1247
were 1248
too 1249
large, 1250
or 1251
the 1252
key 1253
was 1254
too 1255
small, 1256
but 1257
at 1258
any 1259
rate 1260
it 1261
would 1262
not 1263
open 1264
any 1265
of 1266
them. 1267
However, 1268
on 1269
the 1270
second 1271
time 1272
round, 1273
she 1274
came 1275
upon 1276
a 1277
low 1278
curtain 1279
she 1280
had 1281
not 1282
noticed 1283
before, 1284
and 1285
behind 1286
it 1287
was 1288
a 1289
little 1290
door 1291
about 1292
fifteen 1293
inches 1294
high: 1295
she 1296
tried 1297
the 1298
little 1299
golden 1300
key 1301
in 1302
the 1303
lock, 1304
and 1305
to 1306
her 1307
great 1308
delight 1309
it 1310
fitted! 1311
Alice 1312
opened 1313
the 1314
door 1315
and 1316
found 1317
that 1318
it 1319
led 1320
into 1321
a 1322
small 1323
passage, 1324
not 1325
much 1326
larger 1327
than 1328
a 1329
rat-hole: 1330
she 1331
knelt 1332
down 1333
and 1334
looked 1335
along 1336
the 1337
passage 1338
into 1339
the 1340
loveliest 1341
garden 1342
you 1343
ever 1344
saw. 1345
How 1346
she 1347
longed 1348
to 1349
get 1350
out 1351
of 1352
that 1353
dark 1354
hall, 1355
and 1356
wander 1357
about 1358
among 1359
those 1360
beds 1361
of 1362
bright 1363
flowers 1364
and 1365
those 1366
cool 1367
fountains, 1368
but 1369
she 1370
could 1371
not 1372
even 1373
get 1374
her 1375
head 1376
through 1377
the 1378
doorway; 1379
“and 1380
even 1381
if 1382
my 1383
head 1384
would 1385
go 1386
through,” 1387
thought 1388
poor 1389
Alice, 1390
“it 1391
would 1392
be 1393
of 1394
very 1395
little 1396
use 1397
without 1398
my 1399
shoulders. 1400
Oh, 1401
how 1402
I 1403
wish 1404
I 1405
could 1406
shut 1407
up 1408
like 1409
a 1410
telescope! 1411
I 1412
think 1413
I 1414
could, 1415
if 1416
I 1417
only 1418
knew 1419
how 1420
to 1421
begin.” 1422
For, 1423
you 1424
see, 1425
so 1426
many 1427
out-of-the-way 1428
things 1429
had 1430
happened 1431
lately, 1432
that 1433
Alice 1434
had 1435
begun 1436
to 1437
think 1438
that 1439
very 1440
few 1441
things 1442
indeed 1443
were 1444
really 1445
impossible. 1446
There 1447
seemed 1448
to 1449
be 1450
no 1451
use 1452
in 1453
waiting 1454
by 1455
the 1456
little 1457
door, 1458
so 1459
she 1460
went 1461
back 1462
to 1463
the 1464
table, 1465
half 1466
hoping 1467
she 1468
might 1469
find 1470
another 1471
key 1472
on 1473
it, 1474
or 1475
at 1476
any 1477
rate 1478
a 1479
book 1480
of 1481
rules 1482
for 1483
shutting 1484
people 1485
up 1486
like 1487
telescopes: 1488
this 1489
time 1490
she 1491
found 1492
a 1493
little 1494
bottle 1495
on 1496
it, 1497
(“which 1498
certainly 1499
was 1500
not 1501
here 1502
before,” 1503
said 1504
Alice,) 1505
and 1506
round 1507
the 1508
neck 1509
of 1510
the 1511
bottle 1512
was 1513
a 1514
paper 1515
label, 1516
with 1517
the 1518
words 1519
“DRINK 1520
ME,” 1521
beautifully 1522
printed 1523
on 1524
it 1525
in 1526
large 1527
letters. 1528
It 1529
was 1530
all 1531
very 1532
well 1533
to 1534
say 1535
“Drink 1536
me,” 1537
but 1538
the 1539
wise 1540
little 1541
Alice 1542
was 1543
not 1544
going 1545
to 1546
do 1547
_that_ 1548
in 1549
a 1550
hurry. 1551
“No, 1552
I’ll 1553
look 1554
first,” 1555
she 1556
said, 1557
“and 1558
see 1559
whether 1560
it’s 1561
marked 1562
‘_poison_’ 1563
or 1564
not”; 1565
for 1566
she 1567
had 1568
read 1569
several 1570
nice 1571
little 1572
histories 1573
about 1574
children 1575
who 1576
had 1577
got 1578
burnt, 1579
and 1580
eaten 1581
up 1582
by 1583
wild 1584
beasts 1585
and 1586
other 1587
unpleasant 1588
things, 1589
all 1590
because 1591
they 1592
_would_ 1593
not 1594
remember 1595
the 1596
simple 1597
rules 1598
their 1599
friends 1600
had 1601
taught 1602
them: 1603
such 1604
as, 1605
that 1606
a 1607
red-hot 1608
poker 1609
will 1610
burn 1611
you 1612
if 1613
you 1614
hold 1615
it 1616
too 1617
long; 1618
and 1619
that 1620
if 1621
you 1622
cut 1623
your 1624
finger 1625
_very_ 1626
deeply 1627
with 1628
a 1629
knife, 1630
it 1631
usually 1632
bleeds; 1633
and 1634
she 1635
had 1636
never 1637
forgotten 1638
that, 1639
if 1640
you 1641
drink 1642
much 1643
from 1644
a 1645
bottle 1646
marked 1647
“poison,” 1648
it 1649
is 1650
almost 1651
certain 1652
to 1653
disagree 1654
with 1655
you, 1656
sooner 1657
or 1658
later. 1659
However, 1660
this 1661
bottle 1662
was 1663
_not_ 1664
marked 1665
“poison,” 1666
so 1667
Alice 1668
ventured 1669
to 1670
taste 1671
it, 1672
and 1673
finding 1674
it 1675
very 1676
nice, 1677
(it 1678
had, 1679
in 1680
fact, 1681
a 1682
sort 1683
of 1684
mixed 1685
flavour 1686
of 1687
cherry-tart, 1688
custard, 1689
pine-apple, 1690
roast 1691
turkey, 1692
toffee, 1693
and 1694
hot 1695
buttered 1696
toast,) 1697
she 1698
very 1699
soon 1700
finished 1701
it 1702
off. 1703
* 1704
* 1705
* 1706
* 1707
* 1708
* 1709
* 1710
* 1711
* 1712
* 1713
* 1714
* 1715

* 1717
* 1718

* 1721
* 1722
* 1723
“What 1724
a 1725
curious 1726
feeling!” 1727
said 1728
Alice; 1729
“I 1730
must 1731
be 1732
shutting 1733
up 1734
like 1735
a 1736
telescope.” 1737
And 1738
so 1739
it 1740
was 1741
indeed: 1742
she 1743
was 1744
now 1745
only 1746
ten 1747
inches 1748
high, 1749
and 1750
her 1751
face 1752
brightened 1753
up 1754
at 1755
the 1756
thought 1757
that 1758
she 1759
was 1760
now 1761
the 1762
right 1763
size 1764
for 1765
going 1766
through 1767
the 1768
little 1769
door 1770
into 1771
that 1772
lovely 1773
garden. 1774
First, 1775
however, 1776
she 1777
waited 1778
for 1779
a 1780
few 1781
minutes 1782
to 1783
see 1784
if 1785
she 1786
was 1787
going 1788
to 1789
shrink 1790
any 1791
further: 1792
she 1793
felt 1794
a 1795
little 1796
nervous 1797
about 1798
this; 1799
“for 1800
it 1801
might 1802
end, 1803
you 1804
know,” 1805
said 1806
Alice 1807
to 1808
herself, 1809
“in 1810
my 1811
going 1812
out 1813
altogether, 1814
like 1815
a 1816
candle. 1817
I 1818
wonder 1819
what 1820
I 1821
should 1822
be 1823
like 1824
then?” 1825
And 1826
she 1827
tried 1828
to 1829
fancy 1830
what 1831
the 1832
flame 1833
of 1834
a 1835
candle 1836
is 1837
like 1838
after 1839
the 1840
candle 1841
is 1842
blown 1843
out, 1844
for 1845
she 1846
could 1847
not 1848
remember 1849
ever 1850
having 1851
seen 1852
such 1853
a 1854
thing. 1855
After 1856
a 1857
while, 1858
finding 1859
that 1860
nothing 1861
more 1862
happened, 1863
she 1864
decided 1865
on 1866
going 1867
into 1868
the 1869
garden 1870
at 1871
once; 1872
but, 1873
alas 1874
for 1875
poor 1876
Alice! 1877
when 1878
she 1879
got 1880
to 1881
the 1882
door, 1883
she 1884
found 1885
she 1886
had 1887
forgotten 1888
the 1889
little 1890
golden 1891
key, 1892
and 1893
when 1894
she 1895
went 1896
back 1897
to 1898
the 1899
table 1900
for 1901
it, 1902
she 1903
found 1904
she 1905
could 1906
not 1907
possibly 1908
reach 1909
it: 1910
she 1911
could 1912
see 1913
it 1914
quite 1915
plainly 1916
through 1917
the 1918
glass, 1919
and 1920
she 1921
tried 1922
her 1923
best 1924
to 1925
climb 1926
up 1927
one 1928
of 1929
the 1930
legs 1931
of 1932
the 1933
table, 1934
but 1935
it 1936
was 1937
too 1938
slippery; 1939
and 1940
when 1941
she 1942
had 1943
tired 1944
herself 1945
out 1946
with 1947
trying, 1948
the 1949
poor 1950
little 1951
thing 1952
sat 1953
down 1954
and 1955
cried. 1956
“Come, 1957
there’s 1958
no 1959
use 1960
in 1961
crying 1962
like 1963
that!” 1964
said 1965
Alice 1966
to 1967
herself, 1968
rather 1969
sharply; 1970
“I 1971
advise 1972
you 1973
to 1974
leave 1975
off 1976
this 1977
minute!” 1978
She 1979
generally 1980
gave 1981
herself 1982
very 1983
good 1984
advice, 1985
(though 1986
she 1987
very 1988
seldom 1989
followed 1990
it), 1991
and 1992
sometimes 1993
she 1994
scolded 1995
herself 1996
so 1997
severely 1998
as 1999
to 2000
bring 2001
tears 2002
into 2003
her 2004
eyes; 2005
and 2006
once 2007
she 2008
remembered 2009
trying 2010
to 2011
box 2012
her 2013
own 2014
ears 2015
for 2016
having 2017
cheated 2018
herself 2019
in 2020
a 2021
game 2022
of 2023
croquet 2024
she 2025
was 2026
playing 2027
against 2028
herself, 2029
for 2030
this 2031
curious 2032
child 2033
was 2034
very 2035
fond 2036
of 2037
pretending 2038
to 2039
be 2040
two 2041
people. 2042
“But 2043
it’s 2044
no 2045
use 2046
now,” 2047
thought 2048
poor 2049
Alice, 2050
“to 2051
pretend 2052
to 2053
be 2054
two 2055
people! 2056
Why, 2057
there’s 2058
hardly 2059
enough 2060
of 2061
me 2062
left 2063
to 2064
make 2065
_one_ 2066
respectable 2067
person!” 2068
Soon 2069
her 2070
eye 2071
fell 2072
on 2073
a 2074
little 2075
glass 2076
box 2077
that 2078
was 2079
lying 2080
under 2081
the 2082
table: 2083
she 2084
opened 2085
it, 2086
and 2087
found 2088
in 2089
it 2090
a 2091
very 2092
small 2093
cake, 2094
on 2095
which 2096
the 2097
words 2098
“EAT 2099
ME” 2100
were 2101
beautifully 2102
marked 2103
in 2104
currants. 2105
“Well, 2106
I’ll 2107
eat 2108
it,” 2109
said 2110
Alice, 2111
“and 2112
if 2113
it 2114
makes 2115
me 2116
grow 2117
larger, 2118
I 2119
can 2120
reach 2121
the 2122
key; 2123
and 2124
if 2125
it 2126
makes 2127
me 2128
grow 2129
smaller, 2130
I 2131
can 2132
creep 2133
under 2134
the 2135
door; 2136
so 2137
either 2138
way 2139
I’ll 2140
get 2141
into 2142
the 2143
garden, 2144
and 2145
I 2146
don’t 2147
care 2148
which 2149
happens!” 2150
She 2151
ate 2152
a 2153
little 2154
bit, 2155
and 2156
said 2157
anxiously 2158
to 2159
herself, 2160
“Which 2161
way? 2162
Which 2163
way?”, 2164
holding 2165
her 2166
hand 2167
on 2168
the 2169
top 2170
of 2171
her 2172
head 2173
to 2174
feel 2175
which 2176
way 2177
it 2178
was 2179
growing, 2180
and 2181
she 2182
was 2183
quite 2184
surprised 2185
to 2186
find 2187
that 2188
she 2189
remained 2190
the 2191
same 2192
size: 2193
to 2194
be 2195
sure, 2196
this 2197
generally 2198
happens 2199
when 2200
one 2201
eats 2202
cake, 2203
but 2204
Alice 2205
had 2206
got 2207
so 2208
much 2209
into 2210
the 2211
way 2212
of 2213
expecting 2214
nothing 2215
but 2216
out-of-the-way 2217
things 2218
to 2219
happen, 2220
that 2221
it 2222
seemed 2223
quite 2224
dull 2225
and 2226
stupid 2227
for 2228
life 2229
to 2230
go 2231
on 2232
in 2233
the 2234
common 2235
way. 2236
So 2237
she 2238
set 2239
to 2240
work, 2241
and 2242
very 2243
soon 2244
finished 2245
off 2246
the 2247
cake. 2248

CHAPTER 2269
II. 2270
The 2271
Pool 2272
of 2273
Tears 2274
“Curiouser 2275
and 2276
curiouser!” 2277
cried 2278
Alice 2279
(she 2280
was 2281
so 2282
much 2283
surprised, 2284
that 2285
for 2286
the 2287
moment 2288
she 2289
quite 2290
forgot 2291
how 2292
to 2293
speak 2294
good 2295
English); 2296
“now 2297
I’m 2298
opening 2299
out 2300
like 2301
the 2302
largest 2303
telescope 2304
that 2305
ever 2306
was! 2307
Good-bye, 2308
feet!” 2309
(for 2310
when 2311
she 2312
looked 2313
down 2314
at 2315
her 2316
feet, 2317
they 2318
seemed 2319
to 2320
be 2321
almost 2322
out 2323
of 2324
sight, 2325
they 2326
were 2327
getting 2328
so 2329
far 2330
off). 2331
“Oh, 2332
my 2333
poor 2334
little 2335
feet, 2336
I 2337
wonder 2338
who 2339
will 2340
put 2341
on 2342
your 2343
shoes 2344
and 2345
stockings 2346
for 2347
you 2348
now, 2349
dears? 2350
I’m 2351
sure 2352
_I_ 2353
shan’t 2354
be 2355
able! 2356
I 2357
shall 2358
be 2359
a 2360
great 2361
deal 2362
too 2363
far 2364
off 2365
to 2366
trouble 2367
myself 2368
about 2369
you: 2370
you 2371
must 2372
manage 2373
the 2374
best 2375
way 2376
you 2377
can;—but 2378
I 2379
must 2380
be 2381
kind 2382
to 2383
them,” 2384
thought 2385
Alice, 2386
“or 2387
perhaps 2388
they 2389
won’t 2390
walk 2391
the 2392
way 2393
I 2394
want 2395
to 2396
go! 2397
Let 2398
me 2399
see: 2400
I’ll 2401
give 2402
them 2403
a 2404
new 2405
pair 2406
of 2407
boots 2408
every 2409
Christmas.” 2410
And 2411
she 2412
went 2413
on 2414
planning 2415
to 2416
herself 2417
how 2418
she 2419
would 2420
manage 2421
it. 2422
“They 2423
must 2424
go 2425
by 2426
the 2427
carrier,” 2428
she 2429
thought; 2430
“and 2431
how 2432
funny 2433
it’ll 2434
seem, 2435
sending 2436
presents 2437
to 2438
one’s 2439
own 2440
feet! 2441
And 2442
how 2443
odd 2444
the 2445
directions 2446
will 2447
look! 2448
_Alice’s 2449
Right 2450
Foot, 2451
Esq., 2452
Hearthrug, 2453
near 2454
the 2455
Fender,_ 2456
(_with 2457
Alice’s 2458
love_). 2459
Oh 2460
dear, 2461
what 2462
nonsense 2463
I’m 2464
talking!” 2465
Just 2466
then 2467
her 2468
head 2469
struck 2470
against 2471
the 2472
roof 2473
of 2474
the 2475
hall: 2476
in 2477
fact 2478
she 2479
was 2480
now 2481
more 2482
than 2483
nine 2484
feet 2485
high, 2486
and 2487
she 2488
at 2489
once 2490
took 2491
up 2492
the 2493
little 2494
golden 2495
key 2496
and 2497
hurried 2498
off 2499
to 2500
the 2501
garden 2502
door. 2503
Poor 2504
Alice! 2505
It 2506
was 2507
as 2508
much 2509
as 2510
she 2511
could 2512
do, 2513
lying 2514
down 2515
on 2516
one 2517
side, 2518
to 2519
look 2520
through 2521
into 2522
the 2523
garden 2524
with 2525
one 2526
eye; 2527
but 2528
to 2529
get 2530
through 2531
was 2532
more 2533
hopeless 2534
than 2535
ever: 2536
she 2537
sat 2538
down 2539
and 2540
began 2541
to 2542
cry 2543
again. 2544
“You 2545
ought 2546
to 2547
be 2548
ashamed 2549
of 2550
yourself,” 2551
said 2552
Alice, 2553
“a 2554
great 2555
girl 2556
like 2557
you,” 2558
(she 2559
might 2560
well 2561
say 2562
this), 2563
“to 2564
go 2565
on 2566
crying 2567
in 2568
this 2569
way! 2570
Stop 2571
this 2572
moment, 2573
I 2574
tell 2575
you!” 2576
But 2577
she 2578
went 2579
on 2580
all 2581
the 2582
same, 2583
shedding 2584
gallons 2585
of 2586
tears, 2587
until 2588
there 2589
was 2590
a 2591
large 2592
pool 2593
all 2594
round 2595
her, 2596
about 2597
four 2598
inches 2599
deep 2600
and 2601
reaching 2602
half 2603
down 2604
the 2605
hall. 2606
After 2607
a 2608
time 2609
she 2610
heard 2611
a 2612
little 2613
pattering 2614
of 2615
feet 2616
in 2617
the 2618
distance, 2619
and 2620
she 2621
hastily 2622
dried 2623
her 2624
eyes 2625
to 2626
see 2627
what 2628
was 2629
coming. 2630
It 2631
was 2632
the 2633
White 2634
Rabbit 2635
returning, 2636
splendidly 2637
dressed, 2638
with 2639
a 2640
pair 2641
of 2642
white 2643
kid 2644
gloves 2645
in 2646
one 2647
hand 2648
and 2649
a 2650
large 2651
fan 2652
in 2653
the 2654
other: 2655
he 2656
came 2657
trotting 2658
along 2659
in 2660
a 2661
great 2662
hurry, 2663
muttering 2664
to 2665
himself 2666
as 2667
he 2668
came, 2669
“Oh! 2670
the 2671
Duchess, 2672
the 2673
Duchess! 2674
Oh! 2675
won’t 2676
she 2677
be 2678
savage 2679
if 2680
I’ve 2681
kept 2682
her 2683
waiting!” 2684
Alice 2685
felt 2686
so 2687
desperate 2688
that 2689
she 2690
was 2691
ready 2692
to 2693
ask 2694
help 2695
of 2696
any 2697
one; 2698
so, 2699
when 2700
the 2701
Rabbit 2702
came 2703
near 2704
her, 2705
she 2706
began, 2707
in 2708
a 2709
low, 2710
timid 2711
voice, 2712
“If 2713
you 2714
please, 2715
sir—” 2716
The 2717
Rabbit 2718
started 2719
violently, 2720
dropped 2721
the 2722
white 2723
kid 2724
gloves 2725
and 2726
the 2727
fan, 2728
and 2729
skurried 2730
away 2731
into 2732
the 2733
darkness 2734
as 2735
hard 2736
as 2737
he 2738
could 2739
go. 2740
Alice 2741
took 2742
up 2743
the 2744
fan 2745
and 2746
gloves, 2747
and, 2748
as 2749
the 2750
hall 2751
was 2752
very 2753
hot, 2754
she 2755
kept 2756
fanning 2757
herself 2758
all 2759
the 2760
time 2761
she 2762
went 2763
on 2764
talking: 2765
“Dear, 2766
dear! 2767
How 2768
queer 2769
everything 2770
is 2771
to-day! 2772
And 2773
yesterday 2774
things 2775
went 2776
on 2777
just 2778
as 2779
usual. 2780
I 2781
wonder 2782
if 2783
I’ve 2784
been 2785
changed 2786
in 2787
the 2788
night? 2789
Let 2790
me 2791
think: 2792
was 2793
I 2794
the 2795
same 2796
when 2797
I 2798
got 2799
up 2800
this 2801
morning? 2802
I 2803
almost 2804
think 2805
I 2806
can 2807
remember 2808
feeling 2809
a 2810
little 2811
different. 2812
But 2813
if 2814
I’m 2815
not 2816
the 2817
same, 2818
the 2819
next 2820
question 2821
is, 2822
Who 2823
in 2824
the 2825
world 2826
am 2827
I? 2828
Ah, 2829
_that’s_ 2830
the 2831
great 2832
puzzle!” 2833
And 2834
she 2835
began 2836
thinking 2837
over 2838
all 2839
the 2840
children 2841
she 2842
knew 2843
that 2844
were 2845
of 2846
the 2847
same 2848
age 2849
as 2850
herself, 2851
to 2852
see 2853
if 2854
she 2855
could 2856
have 2857
been 2858
changed 2859
for 2860
any 2861
of 2862
them. 2863
“I’m 2864
sure 2865
I’m 2866
not 2867
Ada,” 2868
she 2869
said, 2870
“for 2871
her 2872
hair 2873
goes 2874
in 2875
such 2876
long 2877
ringlets, 2878
and 2879
mine 2880
doesn’t 2881
go 2882
in 2883
ringlets 2884
at 2885
all; 2886
and 2887
I’m 2888
sure 2889
I 2890
can’t 2891
be 2892
Mabel, 2893
for 2894
I 2895
know 2896
all 2897
sorts 2898
of 2899
things, 2900
and 2901
she, 2902
oh! 2903
she 2904
knows 2905
such 2906
a 2907
very 2908
little! 2909
Besides, 2910
_she’s_ 2911
she, 2912
and 2913
_I’m_ 2914
I, 2915
and—oh 2916
dear, 2917
how 2918
puzzling 2919
it 2920
all 2921
is! 2922
I’ll 2923
try 2924
if 2925
I 2926
know 2927
all 2928
the 2929
things 2930
I 2931
used 2932
to 2933
know. 2934
Let 2935
me 2936
see: 2937
four 2938
times 2939
five 2940
is 2941
twelve, 2942
and 2943
four 2944
times 2945
six 2946
is 2947
thirteen, 2948
and 2949
four 2950
times 2951
seven 2952
is—oh 2953
dear! 2954
I 2955
shall 2956
never 2957
get 2958
to 2959
twenty 2960
at 2961
that 2962
rate! 2963
However, 2964
the 2965
Multiplication 2966
Table 2967
doesn’t 2968
signify: 2969
let’s 2970
try 2971
Geography. 2972
London 2973
is 2974
the 2975
capital 2976
of 2977
Paris, 2978
and 2979
Paris 2980
is 2981
the 2982
capital 2983
of 2984
Rome, 2985
and 2986
Rome—no, 2987
_that’s_ 2988
all 2989
wrong, 2990
I’m 2991
certain! 2992
I 2993
must 2994
have 2995
been 2996
changed 2997
for 2998
Mabel! 2999
I’ll 3000
try 3001
and 3002
say 3003
‘_How 3004
doth 3005
the 3006
little_—’” 3007
and 3008
she 3009
crossed 3010
her 3011
hands 3012
on 3013
her 3014
lap 3015
as 3016
if 3017
she 3018
were 3019
saying 3020
lessons, 3021
and 3022
began 3023
to 3024
repeat 3025
it, 3026
but 3027
her 3028
voice 3029
sounded 3030
hoarse 3031
and 3032
strange, 3033
and 3034
the 3035
words 3036
did 3037
not 3038
come 3039
the 3040
same 3041
as 3042
they 3043
used 3044
to 3045
do:— 3046
“How 3047
doth 3048
the 3049
little 3050
crocodile 3051
Improve 3052
his 3053
shining 3054
tail, 3055
And 3056
pour 3057
the 3058
waters 3059
of 3060
the 3061
Nile 3062
On 3063
every 3064
golden 3065
scale! 3066
“How 3067
cheerfully 3068
he 3069
seems 3070
to 3071
grin, 3072
How 3073
neatly 3074
spread 3075
his 3076
claws, 3077
And 3078
welcome 3079
little 3080
fishes 3081
in 3082
With 3083
gently 3084
smiling 3085
jaws!” 3086
“I’m 3087
sure 3088
those 3089
are 3090
not 3091
the 3092
right 3093
words,” 3094
said 3095
poor 3096
Alice, 3097
and 3098
her 3099
eyes 3100
filled 3101
with 3102
tears 3103
again 3104
as 3105
she 3106
went 3107
on, 3108
“I 3109
must 3110
be 3111
Mabel 3112
after 3113
all, 3114
and 3115
I 3116
shall 3117
have 3118
to 3119
go 3120
and 3121
live 3122
in 3123
that 3124
poky 3125
little 3126
house, 3127
and 3128
have 3129
next 3130
to 3131
no 3132
toys 3133
to 3134
play 3135
with, 3136
and 3137
oh! 3138
ever 3139
so 3140
many 3141
lessons 3142
to 3143
learn! 3144
No, 3145
I’ve 3146
made 3147
up 3148
my 3149
mind 3150
about 3151
it; 3152
if 3153
I’m 3154
Mabel, 3155
I’ll 3156
stay 3157
down 3158
here! 3159
It’ll 3160
be 3161
no 3162
use 3163
their 3164
putting 3165
their 3166
heads 3167
down 3168
and 3169
saying 3170
‘Come 3171
up 3172
again, 3173
dear!’ 3174
I 3175
shall 3176
only 3177
look 3178
up 3179
and 3180
say 3181
‘Who 3182
am 3183
I 3184
then? 3185
Tell 3186
me 3187
that 3188
first, 3189
and 3190
then, 3191
if 3192
I 3193
like 3194
being 3195
that 3196
person, 3197
I’ll 3198
come 3199
up: 3200
if 3201
not, 3202
I’ll 3203
stay 3204
down 3205
here 3206
till 3207
I’m 3208
somebody 3209
else’—but, 3210
oh 3211
dear!” 3212
cried 3213
Alice, 3214
with 3215
a 3216
sudden 3217
burst 3218
of 3219
tears, 3220
“I 3221
do 3222
wish 3223
they 3224
_would_ 3225
put 3226
their 3227
heads 3228
down! 3229
I 3230
am 3231
so 3232
_very_ 3233
tired 3234
of 3235
being 3236
all 3237
alone 3238
here!” 3239
As 3240
she 3241
said 3242
this 3243
she 3244
looked 3245
down 3246
at 3247
her 3248
hands, 3249
and 3250
was 3251
surprised 3252
to 3253
see 3254
that 3255
she 3256
had 3257
put 3258
on 3259
one 3260
of 3261
the 3262
Rabbit’s 3263
little 3264
white 3265
kid 3266
gloves 3267
while 3268
she 3269
was 3270
talking. 3271
“How 3272
_can_ 3273
I 3274
have 3275
done 3276
that?” 3277
she 3278
thought. 3279
“I 3280
must 3281
be 3282
growing 3283
small 3284
again.” 3285
She 3286
got 3287
up 3288
and 3289
went 3290
to 3291
the 3292
table 3293
to 3294
measure 3295
herself 3296
by 3297
it, 3298
and 3299
found 3300
that, 3301
as 3302
nearly 3303
as 3304
she 3305
could 3306
guess, 3307
she 3308
was 3309
now 3310
about 3311
two 3312
feet 3313
high, 3314
and 3315
was 3316
going 3317
on 3318
shrinking 3319
rapidly: 3320
she 3321
soon 3322
found 3323
out 3324
that 3325
the 3326
cause 3327
of 3328
this 3329
was 3330
the 3331
fan 3332
she 3333
was 3334
holding, 3335
and 3336
she 3337
dropped 3338
it 3339
hastily, 3340
just 3341
in 3342
time 3343
to 3344
avoid 3345
shrinking 3346
away 3347
altogether. 3348
“That 3349
_was_ 3350
a 3351
narrow 3352
escape!” 3353
said 3354
Alice, 3355
a 3356
good 3357
deal 3358
frightened 3359
at 3360
the 3361
sudden 3362
change, 3363
but 3364
very 3365
glad 3366
to 3367
find 3368
herself 3369
still 3370
in 3371
existence; 3372
“and 3373
now 3374
for 3375
the 3376
garden!” 3377
and 3378
she 3379
ran 3380
with 3381
all 3382
speed 3383
back 3384
to 3385
the 3386
little 3387
door: 3388
but, 3389
alas! 3390
the 3391
little 3392
door 3393
was 3394
shut 3395
again, 3396
and 3397
the 3398
little 3399
golden 3400
key 3401
was 3402
lying 3403
on 3404
the 3405
glass 3406
table 3407
as 3408
before, 3409
“and 3410
things 3411
are 3412
worse 3413
than 3414
ever,” 3415
thought 3416
the 3417
poor 3418
child, 3419
“for 3420
I 3421
never 3422
was 3423
so 3424
small 3425
as 3426
this 3427
before, 3428
never! 3429
And 3430
I 3431
declare 3432
it’s 3433
too 3434
bad, 3435
that 3436
it 3437
is!” 3438
As 3439
she 3440
said 3441
these 3442
words 3443
her 3444
foot 3445
slipped, 3446
and 3447
in 3448
another 3449
moment, 3450
splash! 3451
she 3452
was 3453
up 3454
to 3455
her 3456
chin 3457
in 3458
salt 3459
water. 3460
Her 3461
first 3462
idea 3463
was 3464
that 3465
she 3466
had 3467
somehow 3468
fallen 3469
into 3470
the 3471
sea, 3472
“and 3473
in 3474
that 3475
case 3476
I 3477
can 3478
go 3479
back 3480
by 3481
railway,” 3482
she 3483
said 3484
to 3485
herself. 3486
(Alice 3487
had 3488
been 3489
to 3490
the 3491
seaside 3492
once 3493
in 3494
her 3495
life, 3496
and 3497
had 3498
come 3499
to 3500
the 3501
general 3502
conclusion, 3503
that 3504
wherever 3505
you 3506
go 3507
to 3508
on 3509
the 3510
English 3511
coast 3512
you 3513
find 3514
a 3515
number 3516
of 3517
bathing 3518
machines 3519
in 3520
the 3521
sea, 3522
some 3523
children 3524
digging 3525
in 3526
the 3527
sand 3528
with 3529
wooden 3530
spades, 3531
then 3532
a 3533
row 3534
of 3535
lodging 3536
houses, 3537
and 3538
behind 3539
them 3540
a 3541
railway 3542
station.) 3543
However, 3544
she 3545
soon 3546
made 3547
out 3548
that 3549
she 3550
was 3551
in 3552
the 3553
pool 3554
of 3555
tears 3556
which 3557
she 3558
had 3559
wept 3560
when 3561
she 3562
was 3563
nine 3564
feet 3565
high. 3566
“I 3567
wish 3568
I 3569
hadn’t 3570
cried 3571
so 3572
much!” 3573
said 3574
Alice, 3575
as 3576
she 3577
swam 3578
about, 3579
trying 3580
to 3581
find 3582
her 3583
way 3584
out. 3585
“I 3586
shall 3587
be 3588
punished 3589
for 3590
it 3591
now, 3592
I 3593
suppose, 3594
by 3595
being 3596
drowned 3597
in 3598
my 3599
own 3600
tears! 3601
That 3602
_will_ 3603
be 3604
a 3605
queer 3606
thing, 3607
to 3608
be 3609
sure! 3610
However, 3611
everything 3612
is 3613
queer 3614
to-day.” 3615
Just 3616
then 3617
she 3618
heard 3619
something 3620
splashing 3621
about 3622
in 3623
the 3624
pool 3625
a 3626
little 3627
way 3628
off, 3629
and 3630
she 3631
swam 3632
nearer 3633
to 3634
make 3635
out 3636
what 3637
it 3638
was: 3639
at 3640
first 3641
she 3642
thought 3643
it 3644
must 3645
be 3646
a 3647
walrus 3648
or 3649
hippopotamus, 3650
but 3651
then 3652
she 3653
remembered 3654
how 3655
small 3656
she 3657
was 3658
now, 3659
and 3660
she 3661
soon 3662
made 3663
out 3664
that 3665
it 3666
was 3667
only 3668
a 3669
mouse 3670
that 3671
had 3672
slipped 3673
in 3674
like 3675
herself. 3676
“Would 3677
it 3678
be 3679
of 3680
any 3681
use, 3682
now,” 3683
thought 3684
Alice, 3685
“to 3686
speak 3687
to 3688
this 3689
mouse? 3690
Everything 3691
is 3692
so 3693
out-of-the-way 3694
down 3695
here, 3696
that 3697
I 3698
should 3699
think 3700
very 3701
likely 3702
it 3703
can 3704
talk: 3705
at 3706
any 3707
rate, 3708
there’s 3709
no 3710
harm 3711
in 3712
trying.” 3713
So 3714
she 3715
began: 3716
“O 3717
Mouse, 3718
do 3719
you 3720
know 3721
the 3722
way 3723
out 3724
of 3725
this 3726
pool? 3727
I 3728
am 3729
very 3730
tired 3731
of 3732
swimming 3733
about 3734
here, 3735
O 3736
Mouse!” 3737
(Alice 3738
thought 3739
this 3740
must 3741
be 3742
the 3743
right 3744
way 3745
of 3746
speaking 3747
to 3748
a 3749
mouse: 3750
she 3751
had 3752
never 3753
done 3754
such 3755
a 3756
thing 3757
before, 3758
but 3759
she 3760
remembered 3761
having 3762
seen 3763
in 3764
her 3765
brother’s 3766
Latin 3767
Grammar, 3768
“A 3769
mouse—of 3770
a 3771
mouse—to 3772
a 3773
mouse—a 3774
mouse—O 3775
mouse!”) 3776
The 3777
Mouse 3778
looked 3779
at 3780
her 3781
rather 3782
inquisitively, 3783
and 3784
seemed 3785
to 3786
her 3787
to 3788
wink 3789
with 3790
one 3791
of 3792
its 3793
little 3794
eyes, 3795
but 3796
it 3797
said 3798
nothing. 3799
“Perhaps 3800
it 3801
doesn’t 3802
understand 3803
English,” 3804
thought 3805
Alice; 3806
“I 3807
daresay 3808
it’s 3809
a 3810
French 3811
mouse, 3812
come 3813
over 3814
with 3815
William 3816
the 3817
Conqueror.” 3818
(For, 3819
with 3820
all 3821
her 3822
knowledge 3823
of 3824
history, 3825
Alice 3826
had 3827
no 3828
very 3829
clear 3830
notion 3831
how 3832
long 3833
ago 3834
anything 3835
had 3836
happened.) 3837
So 3838
she 3839
began 3840
again: 3841
“Où 3842
est 3843
ma 3844
chatte?” 3845
which 3846
was 3847
the 3848
first 3849
sentence 3850
in 3851
her 3852
French 3853
lesson-book. 3854
The 3855
Mouse 3856
gave 3857
a 3858
sudden 3859
leap 3860
out 3861
of 3862
the 3863
water, 3864
and 3865
seemed 3866
to 3867
quiver 3868
all 3869
over 3870
with 3871
fright. 3872
“Oh, 3873
I 3874
beg 3875
your 3876
pardon!” 3877
cried 3878
Alice 3879
hastily, 3880
afraid 3881
that 3882
she 3883
had 3884
hurt 3885
the 3886
poor 3887
animal’s 3888
feelings. 3889
“I 3890
quite 3891
forgot 3892
you 3893
didn’t 3894
like 3895
cats.” 3896
“Not 3897
like 3898
cats!” 3899
cried 3900
the 3901
Mouse, 3902
in 3903
a 3904
shrill, 3905
passionate 3906
voice. 3907
“Would 3908
_you_ 3909
like 3910
cats 3911
if 3912
you 3913
were 3914
me?” 3915
“Well, 3916
perhaps 3917
not,” 3918
said 3919
Alice 3920
in 3921
a 3922
soothing 3923
tone: 3924
“don’t 3925
be 3926
angry 3927
about 3928
it. 3929
And 3930
yet 3931
I 3932
wish 3933
I 3934
could 3935
show 3936
you 3937
our 3938
cat 3939
Dinah: 3940
I 3941
think 3942
you’d 3943
take 3944
a 3945
fancy 3946
to 3947
cats 3948
if 3949
you 3950
could 3951
only 3952
see 3953
her. 3954
She 3955
is 3956
such 3957
a 3958
dear 3959
quiet 3960
thing,” 3961
Alice 3962
went 3963
on, 3964
half 3965
to 3966
herself, 3967
as 3968
she 3969
swam 3970
lazily 3971
about 3972
in 3973
the 3974
pool, 3975
“and 3976
she 3977
sits 3978
purring 3979
so 3980
nicely 3981
by 3982
the 3983
fire, 3984
licking 3985
her 3986
paws 3987
and 3988
washing 3989
her 3990
face—and 3991
she 3992
is 3993
such 3994
a 3995
nice 3996
soft 3997
thing 3998
to 3999
nurse—and 4000
she’s 4001
such 4002
a 4003
capital 4004
one 4005
for 4006
catching 4007
mice—oh, 4008
I 4009
beg 4010
your 4011
pardon!” 4012
cried 4013
Alice 4014
again, 4015
for 4016
this 4017
time 4018
the 4019
Mouse 4020
was 4021
bristling 4022
all 4023
over, 4024
and 4025
she 4026
felt 4027
certain 4028
it 4029
must 4030
be 4031
really 4032
offended. 4033
“We 4034
won’t 4035
talk 4036
about 4037
her 4038
any 4039
more 4040
if 4041
you’d 4042
rather 4043
not.” 4044
“We 4045
indeed!” 4046
cried 4047
the 4048
Mouse, 4049
who 4050
was 4051
trembling 4052
down 4053
to 4054
the 4055
end 4056
of 4057
his 4058
tail. 4059
“As 4060
if 4061
_I_ 4062
would 4063
talk 4064
on 4065
such 4066
a 4067
subject! 4068
Our 4069
family 4070
always 4071
_hated_ 4072
cats: 4073
nasty, 4074
low, 4075
vulgar 4076
things! 4077
Don’t 4078
let 4079
me 4080
hear 4081
the 4082
name 4083
again!” 4084
“I 4085
won’t 4086
indeed!” 4087
said 4088
Alice, 4089
in 4090
a 4091
great 4092
hurry 4093
to 4094
change 4095
the 4096
subject 4097
of 4098
conversation. 4099
“Are 4100
you—are 4101
you 4102
fond—of—of 4103
dogs?” 4104
The 4105
Mouse 4106
did 4107
not 4108
answer, 4109
so 4110
Alice 4111
went 4112
on 4113
eagerly: 4114
“There 4115
is 4116
such 4117
a 4118
nice 4119
little 4120
dog 4121
near 4122
our 4123
house 4124
I 4125
should 4126
like 4127
to 4128
show 4129
you! 4130
A 4131
little 4132
bright-eyed 4133
terrier, 4134
you 4135
know, 4136
with 4137
oh, 4138
such 4139
long 4140
curly 4141
brown 4142
hair! 4143
And 4144
it’ll 4145
fetch 4146
things 4147
when 4148
you 4149
throw 4150
them, 4151
and 4152
it’ll 4153
sit 4154
up 4155
and 4156
beg 4157
for 4158
its 4159
dinner, 4160
and 4161
all 4162
sorts 4163
of 4164
things—I 4165
can’t 4166
remember 4167
half 4168
of 4169
them—and 4170
it 4171
belongs 4172
to 4173
a 4174
farmer, 4175
you 4176
know, 4177
and 4178
he 4179
says 4180
it’s 4181
so 4182
useful, 4183
it’s 4184
worth 4185
a 4186
hundred 4187
pounds! 4188
He 4189
says 4190
it 4191
kills 4192
all 4193
the 4194
rats 4195
and—oh 4196
dear!” 4197
cried 4198
Alice 4199
in 4200
a 4201
sorrowful 4202
tone, 4203
“I’m 4204
afraid 4205
I’ve 4206
offended 4207
it 4208
again!” 4209
For 4210
the 4211
Mouse 4212
was 4213
swimming 4214
away 4215
from 4216
her 4217
as 4218
hard 4219
as 4220
it 4221
could 4222
go, 4223
and 4224
making 4225
quite 4226
a 4227
commotion 4228
in 4229
the 4230
pool 4231
as 4232
it 4233
went. 4234
So 4235
she 4236
called 4237
softly 4238
after 4239
it, 4240
“Mouse 4241
dear! 4242
Do 4243
come 4244
back 4245
again, 4246
and 4247
we 4248
won’t 4249
talk 4250
about 4251
cats 4252
or 4253
dogs 4254
either, 4255
if 4256
you 4257
don’t 4258
like 4259
them!” 4260
When 4261
the 4262
Mouse 4263
heard 4264
this, 4265
it 4266
turned 4267
round 4268
and 4269
swam 4270
slowly 4271
back 4272
to 4273
her: 4274
its 4275
face 4276
was 4277
quite 4278
pale 4279
(with 4280
passion, 4281
Alice 4282
thought), 4283
and 4284
it 4285
said 4286
in 4287
a 4288
low 4289
trembling 4290
voice, 4291
“Let 4292
us 4293
get 4294
to 4295
the 4296
shore, 4297
and 4298
then 4299
I’ll 4300
tell 4301
you 4302
my 4303
history, 4304
and 4305
you’ll 4306
understand 4307
why 4308
it 4309
is 4310
I 4311
hate 4312
cats 4313
and 4314
dogs.” 4315
It 4316
was 4317
high 4318
time 4319
to 4320
go, 4321
for 4322
the 4323
pool 4324
was 4325
getting 4326
quite 4327
crowded 4328
with 4329
the 4330
birds 4331
and 4332
animals 4333
that 4334
had 4335
fallen 4336
into 4337
it: 4338
there 4339
were 4340
a 4341
Duck 4342
and 4343
a 4344
Dodo, 4345
a 4346
Lory 4347
and 4348
an 4349
Eaglet, 4350
and 4351
several 4352
other 4353
curious 4354
creatures. 4355
Alice 4356
led 4357
the 4358
way, 4359
and 4360
the 4361
whole 4362
party 4363
swam 4364
to 4365
the 4366
shore. 4367
CHAPTER 4368
III. 4369
A 4370
Caucus-Race 4371
and 4372
a 4373
Long 4374
Tale 4375
They 4376
were 4377
indeed 4378
a 4379
queer-looking 4380
party 4381
that 4382
assembled 4383
on 4384
the 4385
bank—the 4386
birds 4387
with 4388
draggled 4389
feathers, 4390
the 4391
animals 4392
with 4393
their 4394
fur 4395
clinging 4396
close 4397
to 4398
them, 4399
and 4400
all 4401
dripping 4402
wet, 4403
cross, 4404
and 4405
uncomfortable. 4406
The 4407
first 4408
question 4409
of 4410
course 4411
was, 4412
how 4413
to 4414
get 4415
dry 4416
again: 4417
they 4418
had 4419
a 4420
consultation 4421
about 4422
this, 4423
and 4424
after 4425
a 4426
few 4427
minutes 4428
it 4429
seemed 4430
quite 4431
natural 4432
to 4433
Alice 4434
to 4435
find 4436
herself 4437
talking 4438
familiarly 4439
with 4440
them, 4441
as 4442
if 4443
she 4444
had 4445
known 4446
them 4447
all 4448
her 4449
life. 4450
Indeed, 4451
she 4452
had 4453
quite 4454
a 4455
long 4456
argument 4457
with 4458
the 4459
Lory, 4460
who 4461
at 4462
last 4463
turned 4464
sulky, 4465
and 4466
would 4467
only 4468
say, 4469
“I 4470
am 4471
older 4472
than 4473
you, 4474
and 4475
must 4476
know 4477
better;” 4478
and 4479
this 4480
Alice 4481
would 4482
not 4483
allow 4484
without 4485
knowing 4486
how 4487
old 4488
it 4489
was, 4490
and, 4491
as 4492
the 4493
Lory 4494
positively 4495
refused 4496
to 4497
tell 4498
its 4499
age, 4500
there 4501
was 4502
no 4503
more 4504
to 4505
be 4506
said. 4507
At 4508
last 4509
the 4510
Mouse, 4511
who 4512
seemed 4513
to 4514
be 4515
a 4516
person 4517
of 4518
authority 4519
among 4520
them, 4521
called 4522
out, 4523
“Sit 4524
down, 4525
all 4526
of 4527
you, 4528
and 4529
listen 4530
to 4531
me! 4532
_I’ll_ 4533
soon 4534
make 4535
you 4536
dry 4537
enough!” 4538
They 4539
all 4540
sat 4541
down 4542
at 4543
once, 4544
in 4545
a 4546
large 4547
ring, 4548
with 4549
the 4550
Mouse 4551
in 4552
the 4553
middle. 4554
Alice 4555
kept 4556
her 4557
eyes 4558
anxiously 4559
fixed 4560
on 4561
it, 4562
for 4563
she 4564
felt 4565
sure 4566
she 4567
would 4568
catch 4569
a 4570
bad 4571
cold 4572
if 4573
she 4574
did 4575
not 4576
get 4577
dry 4578
very 4579
soon. 4580
“Ahem!” 4581
said 4582
the 4583
Mouse 4584
with 4585
an 4586
important 4587
air, 4588
“are 4589
you 4590
all 4591
ready? 4592
This 4593
is 4594
the 4595
driest 4596
thing 4597
I 4598
know. 4599
Silence 4600
all 4601
round, 4602
if 4603
you 4604
please! 4605
‘William 4606
the 4607
Conqueror, 4608
whose 4609
cause 4610
was 4611
favoured 4612
by 4613
the 4614
pope, 4615
was 4616
soon 4617
submitted 4618
to 4619
by 4620
the 4621
English, 4622
who 4623
wanted 4624
leaders, 4625
and 4626
had 4627
been 4628
of 4629
late 4630
much 4631
accustomed 4632
to 4633
usurpation 4634
and 4635
conquest. 4636
Edwin 4637
and 4638
Morcar, 4639
the 4640
earls 4641
of 4642
Mercia 4643
and 4644
Northumbria—’” 4645
“Ugh!” 4646
said 4647
the 4648
Lory, 4649
with 4650
a 4651
shiver. 4652
“I 4653
beg 4654
your 4655
pardon!” 4656
said 4657
the 4658
Mouse, 4659
frowning, 4660
but 4661
very 4662
politely: 4663
“Did 4664
you 4665
speak?” 4666
“Not 4667
I!” 4668
said 4669
the 4670
Lory 4671
hastily. 4672
“I 4673
thought 4674
you 4675
did,” 4676
said 4677
the 4678
Mouse. 4679
“—I 4680
proceed. 4681
‘Edwin 4682
and 4683
Morcar, 4684
the 4685
earls 4686
of 4687
Mercia 4688
and 4689
Northumbria, 4690
declared 4691
for 4692
him: 4693
and 4694
even 4695
Stigand, 4696
the 4697
patriotic 4698
archbishop 4699
of 4700
Canterbury, 4701
found 4702
it 4703
advisable—’” 4704
“Found 4705
_what_?” 4706
said 4707
the 4708
Duck. 4709
“Found 4710
_it_,” 4711
the 4712
Mouse 4713
replied 4714
rather 4715
crossly: 4716
“of 4717
course 4718
you 4719
know 4720
what 4721
‘it’ 4722
means.” 4723
“I 4724
know 4725
what 4726
‘it’ 4727
means 4728
well 4729
enough, 4730
when 4731
_I_ 4732
find 4733
a 4734
thing,” 4735
said 4736
the 4737
Duck: 4738
“it’s 4739
generally 4740
a 4741
frog 4742
or 4743
a 4744
worm. 4745
The 4746
question 4747
is, 4748
what 4749
did 4750
the 4751
archbishop 4752
find?” 4753
The 4754
Mouse 4755
did 4756
not 4757
notice 4758
this 4759
question, 4760
but 4761
hurriedly 4762
went 4763
on, 4764
“‘—found 4765
it 4766
advisable 4767
to 4768
go 4769
with 4770
Edgar 4771
Atheling 4772
to 4773
meet 4774
William 4775
and 4776
offer 4777
him 4778
the 4779
crown. 4780
William’s 4781
conduct 4782
at 4783
first 4784
was 4785
moderate. 4786
But 4787
the 4788
insolence 4789
of 4790
his 4791
Normans—’ 4792
How 4793
are 4794
you 4795
getting 4796
on 4797
now, 4798
my 4799
dear?” 4800
it 4801
continued, 4802
turning 4803
to 4804
Alice 4805
as 4806
it 4807
spoke. 4808
“As 4809
wet 4810
as 4811
ever,” 4812
said 4813
Alice 4814
in 4815
a 4816
melancholy 4817
tone: 4818
“it 4819
doesn’t 4820
seem 4821
to 4822
dry 4823
me 4824
at 4825
all.” 4826
“In 4827
that 4828
case,” 4829
said 4830
the 4831
Dodo 4832
solemnly, 4833
rising 4834
to 4835
its 4836
feet, 4837
“I 4838
move 4839
that 4840
the 4841
meeting 4842
adjourn, 4843
for 4844
the 4845
immediate 4846
adoption 4847
of 4848
more 4849
energetic 4850
remedies—” 4851
“Speak 4852
English!” 4853
said 4854
the 4855
Eaglet. 4856
“I 4857
don’t 4858
know 4859
the 4860
meaning 4861
of 4862
half 4863
those 4864
long 4865
words, 4866
and, 4867
what’s 4868
more, 4869
I 4870
don’t 4871
believe 4872
you 4873
do 4874
either!” 4875
And 4876
the 4877
Eaglet 4878
bent 4879
down 4880
its 4881
head 4882
to 4883
hide 4884
a 4885
smile: 4886
some 4887
of 4888
the 4889
other 4890
birds 4891
tittered 4892
audibly. 4893
“What 4894
I 4895
was 4896
going 4897
to 4898
say,” 4899
said 4900
the 4901
Dodo 4902
in 4903
an 4904
offended 4905
tone, 4906
“was, 4907
that 4908
the 4909
best 4910
thing 4911
to 4912
get 4913
us 4914
dry 4915
would 4916
be 4917
a 4918
Caucus-race.” 4919
“What 4920
_is_ 4921
a 4922
Caucus-race?” 4923
said 4924
Alice; 4925
not 4926
that 4927
she 4928
wanted 4929
much 4930
to 4931
know, 4932
but 4933
the 4934
Dodo 4935
had 4936
paused 4937
as 4938
if 4939
it 4940
thought 4941
that 4942
_somebody_ 4943
ought 4944
to 4945
speak, 4946
and 4947
no 4948
one 4949
else 4950
seemed 4951
inclined 4952
to 4953
say 4954
anything. 4955
“Why,” 4956
said 4957
the 4958
Dodo, 4959
“the 4960
best 4961
way 4962
to 4963
explain 4964
it 4965
is 4966
to 4967
do 4968
it.” 4969
(And, 4970
as 4971
you 4972
might 4973
like 4974
to 4975
try 4976
the 4977
thing 4978
yourself, 4979
some 4980
winter 4981
day, 4982
I 4983
will 4984
tell 4985
you 4986
how 4987
the 4988
Dodo 4989
managed 4990
it.) 4991
First 4992
it 4993
marked 4994
out 4995
a 4996
race-course, 4997
in 4998
a 4999
sort 5000
of 5001
circle, 5002
(“the 5003
exact 5004
shape 5005
doesn’t 5006
matter,” 5007
it 5008
said,) 5009
and 5010
then 5011
all 5012
the 5013
party 5014
were 5015
placed 5016
along 5017
the 5018
course, 5019
here 5020
and 5021
there. 5022
There 5023
was 5024
no 5025
“One, 5026
two, 5027
three, 5028
and 5029
away,” 5030
but 5031
they 5032
began 5033
running 5034
when 5035
they 5036
liked, 5037
and 5038
left 5039
off 5040
when 5041
they 5042
liked, 5043
so 5044
that 5045
it 5046
was 5047
not 5048
easy 5049
to 5050
know 5051
when 5052
the 5053
race 5054
was 5055
over. 5056
However, 5057
when 5058
they 5059
had 5060
been 5061
running 5062
half 5063
an 5064
hour 5065
or 5066
so, 5067
and 5068
were 5069
quite 5070
dry 5071
again, 5072
the 5073
Dodo 5074
suddenly 5075
called 5076
out 5077
“The 5078
race 5079
is 5080
over!” 5081
and 5082
they 5083
all 5084
crowded 5085
round 5086
it, 5087
panting, 5088
and 5089
asking, 5090
“But 5091
who 5092
has 5093
won?” 5094
This 5095
question 5096
the 5097
Dodo 5098
could 5099
not 5100
answer 5101
without 5102
a 5103
great 5104
deal 5105
of 5106
thought, 5107
and 5108
it 5109
sat 5110
for 5111
a 5112
long 5113
time 5114
with 5115
one 5116
finger 5117
pressed 5118
upon 5119
its 5120
forehead 5121
(the 5122
position 5123
in 5124
which 5125
you 5126
usually 5127
see 5128
Shakespeare, 5129
in 5130
the 5131
pictures 5132
of 5133
him), 5134
while 5135
the 5136
rest 5137
waited 5138
in 5139
silence. 5140
At 5141
last 5142
the 5143
Dodo 5144
said, 5145
“_Everybody_ 5146
has 5147
won, 5148
and 5149
all 5150
must 5151
have 5152
prizes.” 5153
“But 5154
who 5155
is 5156
to 5157
give 5158
the 5159
prizes?” 5160
quite 5161
a 5162
chorus 5163
of 5164
voices 5165
asked. 5166
“Why, 5167
_she_, 5168
of 5169
course,” 5170
said 5171
the 5172
Dodo, 5173
pointing 5174
to 5175
Alice 5176
with 5177
one 5178
finger; 5179
and 5180
the 5181
whole 5182
party 5183
at 5184
once 5185
crowded 5186
round 5187
her, 5188
calling 5189
out 5190
in 5191
a 5192
confused 5193
way, 5194
“Prizes! 5195
Prizes!” 5196
Alice 5197
had 5198
no 5199
idea 5200
what 5201
to 5202
do, 5203
and 5204
in 5205
despair 5206
she 5207
put 5208
her 5209
hand 5210
in 5211
her 5212
pocket, 5213
and 5214
pulled 5215
out 5216
a 5217
box 5218
of 5219
comfits, 5220
(luckily 5221
the 5222
salt 5223
water 5224
had 5225
not 5226
got 5227
into 5228
it), 5229
and 5230
handed 5231
them 5232
round 5233
as 5234
prizes. 5235
There 5236
was 5237
exactly 5238
one 5239
a-piece, 5240
all 5241
round. 5242
“But 5243
she 5244
must 5245
have 5246
a 5247
prize 5248
herself, 5249
you 5250
know,” 5251
said 5252
the 5253
Mouse. 5254
“Of 5255
course,” 5256
the 5257
Dodo 5258
replied 5259
very 5260
gravely. 5261
“What 5262
else 5263
have 5264
you 5265
got 5266
in 5267
your 5268
pocket?” 5269
he 5270
went 5271
on, 5272
turning 5273
to 5274
Alice. 5275
“Only 5276
a 5277
thimble,” 5278
said 5279
Alice 5280
sadly. 5281
“Hand 5282
it 5283
over 5284
here,” 5285
said 5286
the 5287
Dodo. 5288
Then 5289
they 5290
all 5291
crowded 5292
round 5293
her 5294
once 5295
more, 5296
while 5297
the 5298
Dodo 5299
solemnly 5300
presented 5301
the 5302
thimble, 5303
saying 5304
“We 5305
beg 5306
your 5307
acceptance 5308
of 5309
this 5310
elegant 5311
thimble;” 5312
and, 5313
when 5314
it 5315
had 5316
finished 5317
this 5318
short 5319
speech, 5320
they 5321
all 5322
cheered. 5323
Alice 5324
thought 5325
the 5326
whole 5327
thing 5328
very 5329
absurd, 5330
but 5331
they 5332
all 5333
looked 5334
so 5335
grave 5336
that 5337
she 5338
did 5339
not 5340
dare 5341
to 5342
laugh; 5343
and, 5344
as 5345
she 5346
could 5347
not 5348
think 5349
of 5350
anything 5351
to 5352
say, 5353
she 5354
simply 5355
bowed, 5356
and 5357
took 5358
the 5359
thimble, 5360
looking 5361
as 5362
solemn 5363
as 5364
she 5365
could. 5366
The 5367
next 5368
thing 5369
was 5370
to 5371
eat 5372
the 5373
comfits: 5374
this 5375
caused 5376
some 5377
noise 5378
and 5379
confusion, 5380
as 5381
the 5382
large 5383
birds 5384
complained 5385
that 5386
they 5387
could 5388
not 5389
taste 5390
theirs, 5391
and 5392
the 5393
small 5394
ones 5395
choked 5396
and 5397
had 5398
to 5399
be 5400
patted 5401
on 5402
the 5403
back. 5404
However, 5405
it 5406
was 5407
over 5408
at 5409
last, 5410
and 5411
they 5412
sat 5413
down 5414
again 5415
in 5416
a 5417
ring, 5418
and 5419
begged 5420
the 5421
Mouse 5422
to 5423
tell 5424
them 5425
something 5426
more. 5427
“You 5428
promised 5429
to 5430
tell 5431
me 5432
your 5433
history, 5434
you 5435
know,” 5436
said 5437
Alice, 5438
“and 5439
why 5440
it 5441
is 5442
you 5443
hate—C 5444
and 5445
D,” 5446
she 5447
added 5448
in 5449
a 5450
whisper, 5451
half 5452
afraid 5453
that 5454
it 5455
would 5456
be 5457
offended 5458
again. 5459
“Mine 5460
is 5461
a 5462
long 5463
and 5464
a 5465
sad 5466
tale!” 5467
said 5468
the 5469
Mouse, 5470
turning 5471
to 5472
Alice, 5473
and 5474
sighing. 5475
“It 5476
_is_ 5477
a 5478
long 5479
tail, 5480
certainly,” 5481
said 5482
Alice, 5483
looking 5484
down 5485
with 5486
wonder 5487
at 5488
the 5489
Mouse’s 5490
tail; 5491
“but 5492
why 5493
do 5494
you 5495
call 5496
it 5497
sad?” 5498
And 5499
she 5500
kept 5501
on 5502
puzzling 5503
about 5504
it 5505
while 5506
the 5507
Mouse 5508
was 5509
speaking, 5510
so 5511
that 5512
her 5513
idea 5514
of 5515
the 5516
tale 5517
was 5518
something 5519
like 5520
this:— 5521
“Fury 5522
said 5523
to 5524
a 5525
mouse, 5526
That 5527
he 5528
met 5529
in 5530
the 5531
house, 5532
‘Let 5533
us 5534
both 5535
go 5536
to 5537
law: 5538
_I_ 5539
will 5540
prosecute 5541
_you_.—Come, 5542
I’ll 5543
take 5544
no 5545
denial; 5546
We 5547
must 5548
have 5549
a 5550
trial: 5551
For 5552
really 5553
this 5554
morning 5555
I’ve 5556
nothing 5557
to 5558
do.’ 5559
Said 5560
the 5561
mouse 5562
to 5563
the 5564
cur, 5565
‘Such 5566
a 5567
trial, 5568
dear 5569
sir, 5570
With 5571
no 5572
jury 5573
or 5574
judge, 5575
would 5576
be 5577
wasting 5578
our 5579
breath.’ 5580
‘I’ll 5581
be 5582
judge, 5583
I’ll 5584
be 5585
jury,’ 5586
Said 5587
cunning 5588
old 5589
Fury: 5590
‘I’ll 5591
try 5592
the 5593
whole 5594
cause, 5595
and 5596
condemn 5597
you 5598
to 5599
death.’” 5600
“You 5601
are 5602
not 5603
attending!” 5604
said 5605
the 5606
Mouse 5607
to 5608
Alice 5609
severely. 5610
“What 5611
are 5612
you 5613
thinking 5614
of?” 5615
“I 5616
beg 5617
your 5618
pardon,” 5619
said 5620
Alice 5621
very 5622
humbly: 5623
“you 5624
had 5625
got 5626
to 5627
the 5628
fifth 5629
bend, 5630
I 5631
think?” 5632
“I 5633
had 5634
_not!_” 5635
cried 5636
the 5637
Mouse, 5638
sharply 5639
and 5640
very 5641
angrily. 5642
“A 5643
knot!” 5644
said 5645
Alice, 5646
always 5647
ready 5648
to 5649
make 5650
herself 5651
useful, 5652
and 5653
looking 5654
anxiously 5655
about 5656
her. 5657
“Oh, 5658
do 5659
let 5660
me 5661
help 5662
to 5663
undo 5664
it!” 5665
“I 5666
shall 5667
do 5668
nothing 5669
of 5670
the 5671
sort,” 5672
said 5673
the 5674
Mouse, 5675
getting 5676
up 5677
and 5678
walking 5679
away. 5680
“You 5681
insult 5682
me 5683
by 5684
talking 5685
such 5686
nonsense!” 5687
“I 5688
didn’t 5689
mean 5690
it!” 5691
pleaded 5692
poor 5693
Alice. 5694
“But 5695
you’re 5696
so 5697
easily 5698
offended, 5699
you 5700
know!” 5701
The 5702
Mouse 5703
only 5704
growled 5705
in 5706
reply. 5707
“Please 5708
come 5709
back 5710
and 5711
finish 5712
your 5713
story!” 5714
Alice 5715
called 5716
after 5717
it; 5718
and 5719
the 5720
others 5721
all 5722
joined 5723
in 5724
chorus, 5725
“Yes, 5726
please 5727
do!” 5728
but 5729
the 5730
Mouse 5731
only 5732
shook 5733
its 5734
head 5735
impatiently, 5736
and 5737
walked 5738
a 5739
little 5740
quicker. 5741
“What 5742
a 5743
pity 5744
it 5745
wouldn’t 5746
stay!” 5747
sighed 5748
the 5749
Lory, 5750
as 5751
soon 5752
as 5753
it 5754
was 5755
quite 5756
out 5757
of 5758
sight; 5759
and 5760
an 5761
old 5762
Crab 5763
took 5764
the 5765
opportunity 5766
of 5767
saying 5768
to 5769
her 5770
daughter 5771
“Ah, 5772
my 5773
dear! 5774
Let 5775
this 5776
be 5777
a 5778
lesson 5779
to 5780
you 5781
never 5782
to 5783
lose 5784
_your_ 5785
temper!” 5786
“Hold 5787
your 5788
tongue, 5789
Ma!” 5790
said 5791
the 5792
young 5793
Crab, 5794
a 5795
little 5796
snappishly. 5797
“You’re 5798
enough 5799
to 5800
try 5801
the 5802
patience 5803
of 5804
an 5805
oyster!” 5806
“I 5807
wish 5808
I 5809
had 5810
our 5811
Dinah 5812
here, 5813
I 5814
know 5815
I 5816
do!” 5817
said 5818
Alice 5819
aloud, 5820
addressing 5821
nobody 5822
in 5823
particular. 5824
“She’d 5825
soon 5826
fetch 5827
it 5828
back!” 5829
“And 5830
who 5831
is 5832
Dinah, 5833
if 5834
I 5835
might 5836
venture 5837
to 5838
ask 5839
the 5840
question?” 5841
said 5842
the 5843
Lory. 5844
Alice 5845
replied 5846
eagerly, 5847
for 5848
she 5849
was 5850
always 5851
ready 5852
to 5853
talk 5854
about 5855
her 5856
pet: 5857
“Dinah’s 5858
our 5859
cat. 5860
And 5861
she’s 5862
such 5863
a 5864
capital 5865
one 5866
for 5867
catching 5868
mice 5869
you 5870
can’t 5871
think! 5872
And 5873
oh, 5874
I 5875
wish 5876
you 5877
could 5878
see 5879
her 5880
after 5881
the 5882
birds! 5883
Why, 5884
she’ll 5885
eat 5886
a 5887
little 5888
bird 5889
as 5890
soon 5891
as 5892
look 5893
at 5894
it!” 5895
This 5896
speech 5897
caused 5898
a 5899
remarkable 5900
sensation 5901
among 5902
the 5903
party. 5904
Some 5905
of 5906
the 5907
birds 5908
hurried 5909
off 5910
at 5911
once: 5912
one 5913
old 5914
Magpie 5915
began 5916
wrapping 5917
itself 5918
up 5919
very 5920
carefully, 5921
remarking, 5922
“I 5923
really 5924
must 5925
be 5926
getting 5927
home; 5928
the 5929
night-air 5930
doesn’t 5931
suit 5932
my 5933
throat!” 5934
and 5935
a 5936
Canary 5937
called 5938
out 5939
in 5940
a 5941
trembling 5942
voice 5943
to 5944
its 5945
children, 5946
“Come 5947
away, 5948
my 5949
dears! 5950
It’s 5951
high 5952
time 5953
you 5954
were 5955
all 5956
in 5957
bed!” 5958
On 5959
various 5960
pretexts 5961
they 5962
all 5963
moved 5964
off, 5965
and 5966
Alice 5967
was 5968
soon 5969
left 5970
alone. 5971
“I 5972
wish 5973
I 5974
hadn’t 5975
mentioned 5976
Dinah!” 5977
she 5978
said 5979
to 5980
herself 5981
in 5982
a 5983
melancholy 5984
tone. 5985
“Nobody 5986
seems 5987
to 5988
like 5989
her, 5990
down 5991
here, 5992
and 5993
I’m 5994
sure 5995
she’s 5996
the 5997
best 5998
cat 5999
in 6000
the 6001
world! 6002
Oh, 6003
my 6004
dear 6005
Dinah! 6006
I 6007
wonder 6008
if 6009
I 6010
shall 6011
ever 6012
see 6013
you 6014
any 6015
more!” 6016
And 6017
here 6018
poor 6019
Alice 6020
began 6021
to 6022
cry 6023
again, 6024
for 6025
she 6026
felt 6027
very 6028
lonely 6029
and 6030
low-spirited. 6031
In 6032
a 6033
little 6034
while, 6035
however, 6036
she 6037
again 6038
heard 6039
a 6040
little 6041
pattering 6042
of 6043
footsteps 6044
in 6045
the 6046
distance, 6047
and 6048
she 6049
looked 6050
up 6051
eagerly, 6052
half 6053
hoping 6054
that 6055
the 6056
Mouse 6057
had 6058
changed 6059
his 6060
mind, 6061
and 6062
was 6063
coming 6064
back 6065
to 6066
finish 6067
his 6068
story. 6069
CHAPTER 6070
IV. 6071
The 6072
Rabbit 6073
Sends 6074
in 6075
a 6076
Little 6077
Bill 6078
It 6079
was 6080
the 6081
White 6082
Rabbit, 6083
trotting 6084
slowly 6085
back 6086
again, 6087
and 6088
looking 6089
anxiously 6090
about 6091
as 6092
it 6093
went, 6094
as 6095
if 6096
it 6097
had 6098
lost 6099
something; 6100
and 6101
she 6102
heard 6103
it 6104
muttering 6105
to 6106
itself 6107
“The 6108
Duchess! 6109
The 6110
Duchess! 6111
Oh 6112
my 6113
dear 6114
paws! 6115
Oh 6116
my 6117
fur 6118
and 6119
whiskers! 6120
She’ll 6121
get 6122
me 6123
executed, 6124
as 6125
sure 6126
as 6127
ferrets 6128
are 6129
ferrets! 6130
Where 6131
_can_ 6132
I 6133
have 6134
dropped 6135
them, 6136
I 6137
wonder?” 6138
Alice 6139
guessed 6140
in 6141
a 6142
moment 6143
that 6144
it 6145
was 6146
looking 6147
for 6148
the 6149
fan 6150
and 6151
the 6152
pair 6153
of 6154
white 6155
kid 6156
gloves, 6157
and 6158
she 6159
very 6160
good-naturedly 6161
began 6162
hunting 6163
about 6164
for 6165
them, 6166
but 6167
they 6168
were 6169
nowhere 6170
to 6171
be 6172
seen—everything 6173
seemed 6174
to 6175
have 6176
changed 6177
since 6178
her 6179
swim 6180
in 6181
the 6182
pool, 6183
and 6184
the 6185
great 6186
hall, 6187
with 6188
the 6189
glass 6190
table 6191
and 6192
the 6193
little 6194
door, 6195
had 6196
vanished 6197
completely. 6198
Very 6199
soon 6200
the 6201
Rabbit 6202
noticed 6203
Alice, 6204
as 6205
she 6206
went 6207
hunting 6208
about, 6209
and 6210
called 6211
out 6212
to 6213
her 6214
in 6215
an 6216
angry 6217
tone, 6218
“Why, 6219
Mary 6220
Ann, 6221
what 6222
_are_ 6223
you 6224
doing 6225
out 6226
here? 6227
Run 6228
home 6229
this 6230
moment, 6231
and 6232
fetch 6233
me 6234
a 6235
pair 6236
of 6237
gloves 6238
and 6239
a 6240
fan! 6241
Quick, 6242
now!” 6243
And 6244
Alice 6245
was 6246
so 6247
much 6248
frightened 6249
that 6250
she 6251
ran 6252
off 6253
at 6254
once 6255
in 6256
the 6257
direction 6258
it 6259
pointed 6260
to, 6261
without 6262
trying 6263
to 6264
explain 6265
the 6266
mistake 6267
it 6268
had 6269
made. 6270
“He 6271
took 6272
me 6273
for 6274
his 6275
housemaid,” 6276
she 6277
said 6278
to 6279
herself 6280
as 6281
she 6282
ran. 6283
“How 6284
surprised 6285
he’ll 6286
be 6287
when 6288
he 6289
finds 6290
out 6291
who 6292
I 6293
am! 6294
But 6295
I’d 6296
better 6297
take 6298
him 6299
his 6300
fan 6301
and 6302
gloves—that 6303
is, 6304
if 6305
I 6306
can 6307
find 6308
them.” 6309
As 6310
she 6311
said 6312
this, 6313
she 6314
came 6315
upon 6316
a 6317
neat 6318
little 6319
house, 6320
on 6321
the 6322
door 6323
of 6324
which 6325
was 6326
a 6327
bright 6328
brass 6329
plate 6330
with 6331
the 6332
name 6333
“W. 6334
RABBIT,” 6335
engraved 6336
upon 6337
it. 6338
She 6339
went 6340
in 6341
without 6342
knocking, 6343
and 6344
hurried 6345
upstairs, 6346
in 6347
great 6348
fear 6349
lest 6350
she 6351
should 6352
meet 6353
the 6354
real 6355
Mary 6356
Ann, 6357
and 6358
be 6359
turned 6360
out 6361
of 6362
the 6363
house 6364
before 6365
she 6366
had 6367
found 6368
the 6369
fan 6370
and 6371
gloves. 6372
“How 6373
queer 6374
it 6375
seems,” 6376
Alice 6377
said 6378
to 6379
herself, 6380
“to 6381
be 6382
going 6383
messages 6384
for 6385
a 6386
rabbit! 6387
I 6388
suppose 6389
Dinah’ll 6390
be 6391
sending 6392
me 6393
on 6394
messages 6395
next!” 6396
And 6397
she 6398
began 6399
fancying 6400
the 6401
sort 6402
of 6403
thing 6404
that 6405
would 6406
happen: 6407
“‘Miss 6408
Alice! 6409
Come 6410
here 6411
directly, 6412
and 6413
get 6414
ready 6415
for 6416
your 6417
walk!’ 6418
‘Coming 6419
in 6420
a 6421
minute, 6422
nurse! 6423
But 6424
I’ve 6425
got 6426
to 6427
see 6428
that 6429
the 6430
mouse 6431
doesn’t 6432
get 6433
out.’ 6434
Only 6435
I 6436
don’t 6437
think,” 6438
Alice 6439
went 6440
on, 6441
“that 6442
they’d 6443
let 6444
Dinah 6445
stop 6446
in 6447
the 6448
house 6449
if 6450
it 6451
began 6452
ordering 6453
people 6454
about 6455
like 6456
that!” 6457
By 6458
this 6459
time 6460
she 6461
had 6462
found 6463
her 6464
way 6465
into 6466
a 6467
tidy 6468
little 6469
room 6470
with 6471
a 6472
table 6473
in 6474
the 6475
window, 6476
and 6477
on 6478
it 6479
(as 6480
she 6481
had 6482
hoped) 6483
a 6484
fan 6485
and 6486
two 6487
or 6488
three 6489
pairs 6490
of 6491
tiny 6492
white 6493
kid 6494
gloves: 6495
she 6496
took 6497
up 6498
the 6499
fan 6500
and 6501
a 6502
pair 6503
of 6504
the 6505
gloves, 6506
and 6507
was 6508
just 6509
going 6510
to 6511
leave 6512
the 6513
room, 6514
when 6515
her 6516
eye 6517
fell 6518
upon 6519
a 6520
little 6521
bottle 6522
that 6523
stood 6524
near 6525
the 6526
looking-glass. 6527
There 6528
was 6529
no 6530
label 6531
this 6532
time 6533
with 6534
the 6535
words 6536
“DRINK 6537
ME,” 6538
but 6539
nevertheless 6540
she 6541
uncorked 6542
it 6543
and 6544
put 6545
it 6546
to 6547
her 6548
lips. 6549
“I 6550
know 6551
_something_ 6552
interesting 6553
is 6554
sure 6555
to 6556
happen,” 6557
she 6558
said 6559
to 6560
herself, 6561
“whenever 6562
I 6563
eat 6564
or 6565
drink 6566
anything; 6567
so 6568
I’ll 6569
just 6570
see 6571
what 6572
this 6573
bottle 6574
does. 6575
I 6576
do 6577
hope 6578
it’ll 6579
make 6580
me 6581
grow 6582
large 6583
again, 6584
for 6585
really 6586
I’m 6587
quite 6588
tired 6589
of 6590
being 6591
such 6592
a 6593
tiny 6594
little 6595
thing!” 6596
It 6597
did 6598
so 6599
indeed, 6600
and 6601
much 6602
sooner 6603
than 6604
she 6605
had 6606
expected: 6607
before 6608
she 6609
had 6610
drunk 6611
half 6612
the 6613
bottle, 6614
she 6615
found 6616
her 6617
head 6618
pressing 6619
against 6620
the 6621
ceiling, 6622
and 6623
had 6624
to 6625
stoop 6626
to 6627
save 6628
her 6629
neck 6630
from 6631
being 6632
broken. 6633
She 6634
hastily 6635
put 6636
down 6637
the 6638
bottle, 6639
saying 6640
to 6641
herself 6642
“That’s 6643
quite 6644
enough—I 6645
hope 6646
I 6647
shan’t 6648
grow 6649
any 6650
more—As 6651
it 6652
is, 6653
I 6654
can’t 6655
get 6656
out 6657
at 6658
the 6659
door—I 6660
do 6661
wish 6662
I 6663
hadn’t 6664
drunk 6665
quite 6666
so 6667
much!” 6668
Alas! 6669
it 6670
was 6671
too 6672
late 6673
to 6674
wish 6675
that! 6676
She 6677
went 6678
on 6679
growing, 6680
and 6681
growing, 6682
and 6683
very 6684
soon 6685
had 6686
to 6687
kneel 6688
down 6689
on 6690
the 6691
floor: 6692
in 6693
another 6694
minute 6695
there 6696
was 6697
not 6698
even 6699
room 6700
for 6701
this, 6702
and 6703
she 6704
tried 6705
the 6706
effect 6707
of 6708
lying 6709
down 6710
with 6711
one 6712
elbow 6713
against 6714
the 6715
door, 6716
and 6717
the 6718
other 6719
arm 6720
curled 6721
round 6722
her 6723
head. 6724
Still 6725
she 6726
went 6727
on 6728
growing, 6729
and, 6730
as 6731
a 6732
last 6733
resource, 6734
she 6735
put 6736
one 6737
arm 6738
out 6739
of 6740
the 6741
window, 6742
and 6743
one 6744
foot 6745
up 6746
the 6747
chimney, 6748
and 6749
said 6750
to 6751
herself 6752
“Now 6753
I 6754
can 6755
do 6756
no 6757
more, 6758
whatever 6759
happens. 6760
What 6761
_will_ 6762
become 6763
of 6764
me?” 6765
Luckily 6766
for 6767
Alice, 6768
the 6769
little 6770
magic 6771
bottle 6772
had 6773
now 6774
had 6775
its 6776
full 6777
effect, 6778
and 6779
she 6780
grew 6781
no 6782
larger: 6783
still 6784
it 6785
was 6786
very 6787
uncomfortable, 6788
and, 6789
as 6790
there 6791
seemed 6792
to 6793
be 6794
no 6795
sort 6796
of 6797
chance 6798
of 6799
her 6800
ever 6801
getting 6802
out 6803
of 6804
the 6805
room 6806
again, 6807
no 6808
wonder 6809
she 6810
felt 6811
unhappy. 6812
“It 6813
was 6814
much 6815
pleasanter 6816
at 6817
home,” 6818
thought 6819
poor 6820
Alice, 6821
“when 6822
one 6823
wasn’t 6824
always 6825
growing 6826
larger 6827
and 6828
smaller, 6829
and 6830
being 6831
ordered 6832
about 6833
by 6834
mice 6835
and 6836
rabbits. 6837
I 6838
almost 6839
wish 6840
I 6841
hadn’t 6842
gone 6843
down 6844
that 6845
rabbit-hole—and 6846
yet—and 6847
yet—it’s 6848
rather 6849
curious, 6850
you 6851
know, 6852
this 6853
sort 6854
of 6855
life! 6856
I 6857
do 6858
wonder 6859
what 6860
_can_ 6861
have 6862
happened 6863
to 6864
me! 6865
When 6866
I 6867
used 6868
to 6869
read 6870
fairy-tales, 6871
I 6872
fancied 6873
that 6874
kind 6875
of 6876
thing 6877
never 6878
happened, 6879
and 6880
now 6881
here 6882
I 6883
am 6884
in 6885
the 6886
middle 6887
of 6888
one! 6889
There 6890
ought 6891
to 6892
be 6893
a 6894
book 6895
written 6896
about 6897
me, 6898
that 6899
there 6900
ought! 6901
And 6902
when 6903
I 6904
grow 6905
up, 6906
I’ll 6907
write 6908
one—but 6909
I’m 6910
grown 6911
up 6912
now,” 6913
she 6914
added 6915
in 6916
a 6917
sorrowful 6918
tone; 6919
“at 6920
least 6921
there’s 6922
no 6923
room 6924
to 6925
grow 6926
up 6927
any 6928
more 6929
_here_.” 6930
“But 6931
then,” 6932
thought 6933
Alice, 6934
“shall 6935
I 6936
_never_ 6937
get 6938
any 6939
older 6940
than 6941
I 6942
am 6943
now? 6944
That’ll 6945
be 6946
a 6947
comfort, 6948
one 6949
way—never 6950
to 6951
be 6952
an 6953
old 6954
woman—but 6955
then—always 6956
to 6957
have 6958
lessons 6959
to 6960
learn! 6961
Oh, 6962
I 6963
shouldn’t 6964
like 6965
_that!_” 6966
“Oh, 6967
you 6968
foolish 6969
Alice!” 6970
she 6971
answered 6972
herself. 6973
“How 6974
can 6975
you 6976
learn 6977
lessons 6978
in 6979
here? 6980
Why, 6981
there’s 6982
hardly 6983
room 6984
for 6985
_you_, 6986
and 6987
no 6988
room 6989
at 6990
all 6991
for 6992
any 6993
lesson-books!” 6994
And 6995
so 6996
she 6997
went 6998
on, 6999
taking 7000
first 7001
one 7002
side 7003
and 7004
then 7005
the 7006
other, 7007
and 7008
making 7009
quite 7010
a 7011
conversation 7012
of 7013
it 7014
altogether; 7015
but 7016
after 7017
a 7018
few 7019
minutes 7020
she 7021
heard 7022
a 7023
voice 7024
outside, 7025
and 7026
stopped 7027
to 7028
listen. 7029
“Mary 7030
Ann! 7031
Mary 7032
Ann!” 7033
said 7034
the 7035
voice. 7036
“Fetch 7037
me 7038
my 7039
gloves 7040
this 7041
moment!” 7042
Then 7043
came 7044
a 7045
little 7046
pattering 7047
of 7048
feet 7049
on 7050
the 7051
stairs. 7052
Alice 7053
knew 7054
it 7055
was 7056
the 7057
Rabbit 7058
coming 7059
to 7060
look 7061
for 7062
her, 7063
and 7064
she 7065
trembled 7066
till 7067
she 7068
shook 7069
the 7070
house, 7071
quite 7072
forgetting 7073
that 7074
she 7075
was 7076
now 7077
about 7078
a 7079
thousand 7080
times 7081
as 7082
large 7083
as 7084
the 7085
Rabbit, 7086
and 7087
had 7088
no 7089
reason 7090
to 7091
be 7092
afraid 7093
of 7094
it. 7095
Presently 7096
the 7097
Rabbit 7098
came 7099
up 7100
to 7101
the 7102
door, 7103
and 7104
tried 7105
to 7106
open 7107
it; 7108
but, 7109
as 7110
the 7111
door 7112
opened 7113
inwards, 7114
and 7115
Alice’s 7116
elbow 7117
was 7118
pressed 7119
hard 7120
against 7121
it, 7122
that 7123
attempt 7124
proved 7125
a 7126
failure. 7127
Alice 7128
heard 7129
it 7130
say 7131
to 7132
itself 7133
“Then 7134
I’ll 7135
go 7136
round 7137
and 7138
get 7139
in 7140
at 7141
the 7142
window.” 7143
“_That_ 7144
you 7145
won’t!” 7146
thought 7147
Alice, 7148
and, 7149
after 7150
waiting 7151
till 7152
she 7153
fancied 7154
she 7155
heard 7156
the 7157
Rabbit 7158
just 7159
under 7160
the 7161
window, 7162
she 7163
suddenly 7164
spread 7165
out 7166
her 7167
hand, 7168
and 7169
made 7170
a 7171
snatch 7172
in 7173
the 7174
air. 7175
She 7176
did 7177
not 7178
get 7179
hold 7180
of 7181
anything, 7182
but 7183
she 7184
heard 7185
a 7186
little 7187
shriek 7188
and 7189
a 7190
fall, 7191
and 7192
a 7193
crash 7194
of 7195
broken 7196
glass, 7197
from 7198
which 7199
she 7200
concluded 7201
that 7202
it 7203
was 7204
just 7205
possible 7206
it 7207
had 7208
fallen 7209
into 7210
a 7211
cucumber-frame, 7212
or 7213
something 7214
of 7215
the 7216
sort. 7217
Next 7218
came 7219
an 7220
angry 7221
voice—the 7222
Rabbit’s—“Pat! 7223
Pat! 7224
Where 7225
are 7226
you?” 7227
And 7228
then 7229
a 7230
voice 7231
she 7232
had 7233
never 7234
heard 7235
before, 7236
“Sure 7237
then 7238
I’m 7239
here! 7240
Digging 7241
for 7242
apples, 7243
yer 7244
honour!” 7245
“Digging 7246
for 7247
apples, 7248
indeed!” 7249
said 7250
the 7251
Rabbit 7252
angrily. 7253
“Here! 7254
Come 7255
and 7256
help 7257
me 7258
out 7259
of 7260
_this!_” 7261
(Sounds 7262
of 7263
more 7264
broken 7265
glass.) 7266
“Now 7267
tell 7268
me, 7269
Pat, 7270
what’s 7271
that 7272
in 7273
the 7274
window?” 7275
“Sure, 7276
it’s 7277
an 7278
arm, 7279
yer 7280
honour!” 7281
(He 7282
pronounced 7283
it 7284
“arrum.”) 7285
“An 7286
arm, 7287
you 7288
goose! 7289
Who 7290
ever 7291
saw 7292
one 7293
that 7294
size? 7295
Why, 7296
it 7297
fills 7298
the 7299
whole 7300
window!” 7301
“Sure, 7302
it 7303
does, 7304
yer 7305
honour: 7306
but 7307
it’s 7308
an 7309
arm 7310
for 7311
all 7312
that.” 7313
“Well, 7314
it’s 7315
got 7316
no 7317
business 7318
there, 7319
at 7320
any 7321
rate: 7322
go 7323
and 7324
take 7325
it 7326
away!” 7327
There 7328
was 7329
a 7330
long 7331
silence 7332
after 7333
this, 7334
and 7335
Alice 7336
could 7337
only 7338
hear 7339
whispers 7340
now 7341
and 7342
then; 7343
such 7344
as, 7345
“Sure, 7346
I 7347
don’t 7348
like 7349
it, 7350
yer 7351
honour, 7352
at 7353
all, 7354
at 7355
all!” 7356
“Do 7357
as 7358
I 7359
tell 7360
you, 7361
you 7362
coward!” 7363
and 7364
at 7365
last 7366
she 7367
spread 7368
out 7369
her 7370
hand 7371
again, 7372
and 7373
made 7374
another 7375
snatch 7376
in 7377
the 7378
air. 7379
This 7380
time 7381
there 7382
were 7383
_two_ 7384
little 7385
shrieks, 7386
and 7387
more 7388
sounds 7389
of 7390
broken 7391
glass. 7392
“What 7393
a 7394
number 7395
of 7396
cucumber-frames 7397
there 7398
must 7399
be!” 7400
thought 7401
Alice. 7402
“I 7403
wonder 7404
what 7405
they’ll 7406
do 7407
next! 7408
As 7409
for 7410
pulling 7411
me 7412
out 7413
of 7414
the 7415
window, 7416
I 7417
only 7418
wish 7419
they 7420
_could!_ 7421
I’m 7422
sure 7423
_I_ 7424
don’t 7425
want 7426
to 7427
stay 7428
in 7429
here 7430
any 7431
longer!” 7432
She 7433
waited 7434
for 7435
some 7436
time 7437
without 7438
hearing 7439
anything 7440
more: 7441
at 7442
last 7443
came 7444
a 7445
rumbling 7446
of 7447
little 7448
cartwheels, 7449
and 7450
the 7451
sound 7452
of 7453
a 7454
good 7455
many 7456
voices 7457
all 7458
talking 7459
together: 7460
she 7461
made 7462
out 7463
the 7464
words: 7465
“Where’s 7466
the 7467
other 7468
ladder?—Why, 7469
I 7470
hadn’t 7471
to 7472
bring 7473
but 7474
one; 7475
Bill’s 7476
got 7477
the 7478
other—Bill! 7479
fetch 7480
it 7481
here, 7482
lad!—Here, 7483
put 7484
’em 7485
up 7486
at 7487
this 7488
corner—No, 7489
tie 7490
’em 7491
together 7492
first—they 7493
don’t 7494
reach 7495
half 7496
high 7497
enough 7498
yet—Oh! 7499
they’ll 7500
do 7501
well 7502
enough; 7503
don’t 7504
be 7505
particular—Here, 7506
Bill! 7507
catch 7508
hold 7509
of 7510
this 7511
rope—Will 7512
the 7513
roof 7514
bear?—Mind 7515
that 7516
loose 7517
slate—Oh, 7518
it’s 7519
coming 7520
down! 7521
Heads 7522
below!” 7523
(a 7524
loud 7525
crash)—“Now, 7526
who 7527
did 7528
that?—It 7529
was 7530
Bill, 7531
I 7532
fancy—Who’s 7533
to 7534
go 7535
down 7536
the 7537
chimney?—Nay, 7538
_I_ 7539
shan’t! 7540
_You_ 7541
do 7542
it!—_That_ 7543
I 7544
won’t, 7545
then!—Bill’s 7546
to 7547
go 7548
down—Here, 7549
Bill! 7550
the 7551
master 7552
says 7553
you’re 7554
to 7555
go 7556
down 7557
the 7558
chimney!” 7559
“Oh! 7560
So 7561
Bill’s 7562
got 7563
to 7564
come 7565
down 7566
the 7567
chimney, 7568
has 7569
he?” 7570
said 7571
Alice 7572
to 7573
herself. 7574
“Shy, 7575
they 7576
seem 7577
to 7578
put 7579
everything 7580
upon 7581
Bill! 7582
I 7583
wouldn’t 7584
be 7585
in 7586
Bill’s 7587
place 7588
for 7589
a 7590
good 7591
deal: 7592
this 7593
fireplace 7594
is 7595
narrow, 7596
to 7597
be 7598
sure; 7599
but 7600
I 7601
_think_ 7602
I 7603
can 7604
kick 7605
a 7606
little!” 7607
She 7608
drew 7609
her 7610
foot 7611
as 7612
far 7613
down 7614
the 7615
chimney 7616
as 7617
she 7618
could, 7619
and 7620
waited 7621
till 7622
she 7623
heard 7624
a 7625
little 7626
animal 7627
(she 7628
couldn’t 7629
guess 7630
of 7631
what 7632
sort 7633
it 7634
was) 7635
scratching 7636
and 7637
scrambling 7638
about 7639
in 7640
the 7641
chimney 7642
close 7643
above 7644
her: 7645
then, 7646
saying 7647
to 7648
herself 7649
“This 7650
is 7651
Bill,” 7652
she 7653
gave 7654
one 7655
sharp 7656
kick, 7657
and 7658
waited 7659
to 7660
see 7661
what 7662
would 7663
happen 7664
next. 7665
The 7666
first 7667
thing 7668
she 7669
heard 7670
was 7671
a 7672
general 7673
chorus 7674
of 7675
“There 7676
goes 7677
Bill!” 7678
then 7679
the 7680
Rabbit’s 7681
voice 7682
along—“Catch 7683
him, 7684
you 7685
by 7686
the 7687
hedge!” 7688
then 7689
silence, 7690
and 7691
then 7692
another 7693
confusion 7694
of 7695
voices—“Hold 7696
up 7697
his 7698
head—Brandy 7699
now—Don’t 7700
choke 7701
him—How 7702
was 7703
it, 7704
old 7705
fellow? 7706
What 7707
happened 7708
to 7709
you? 7710
Tell 7711
us 7712
all 7713
about 7714
it!” 7715
Last 7716
came 7717
a 7718
little 7719
feeble, 7720
squeaking 7721
voice, 7722
(“That’s 7723
Bill,” 7724
thought 7725
Alice,) 7726
“Well, 7727
I 7728
hardly 7729
know—No 7730
more, 7731
thank 7732
ye; 7733
I’m 7734
better 7735
now—but 7736
I’m 7737
a 7738
deal 7739
too 7740
flustered 7741
to 7742
tell 7743
you—all 7744
I 7745
know 7746
is, 7747
something 7748
comes 7749
at 7750
me 7751
like 7752
a 7753
Jack-in-the-box, 7754
and 7755
up 7756
I 7757
goes 7758
like 7759
a 7760
sky-rocket!” 7761
“So 7762
you 7763
did, 7764
old 7765
fellow!” 7766
said 7767
the 7768
others. 7769
“We 7770
must 7771
burn 7772
the 7773
house 7774
down!” 7775
said 7776
the 7777
Rabbit’s 7778
voice; 7779
and 7780
Alice 7781
called 7782
out 7783
as 7784
loud 7785
as 7786
she 7787
could, 7788
“If 7789
you 7790
do, 7791
I’ll 7792
set 7793
Dinah 7794
at 7795
you!” 7796
There 7797
was 7798
a 7799
dead 7800
silence 7801
instantly, 7802
and 7803
Alice 7804
thought 7805
to 7806
herself, 7807
“I 7808
wonder 7809
what 7810
they 7811
_will_ 7812
do 7813
next! 7814
If 7815
they 7816
had 7817
any 7818
sense, 7819
they’d 7820
take 7821
the 7822
roof 7823
off.” 7824
After 7825
a 7826
minute 7827
or 7828
two, 7829
they 7830
began 7831
moving 7832
about 7833
again, 7834
and 7835
Alice 7836
heard 7837
the 7838
Rabbit 7839
say, 7840
“A 7841
barrowful 7842
will 7843
do, 7844
to 7845
begin 7846
with.” 7847
“A 7848
barrowful 7849
of 7850
_what?_” 7851
thought 7852
Alice; 7853
but 7854
she 7855
had 7856
not 7857
long 7858
to 7859
doubt, 7860
for 7861
the 7862
next 7863
moment 7864
a 7865
shower 7866
of 7867
little 7868
pebbles 7869
came 7870
rattling 7871
in 7872
at 7873
the 7874
window, 7875
and 7876
some 7877
of 7878
them 7879
hit 7880
her 7881
in 7882
the 7883
face. 7884
“I’ll 7885
put 7886
a 7887
stop 7888
to 7889
this,” 7890
she 7891
said 7892
to 7893
herself, 7894
and 7895
shouted 7896
out, 7897
“You’d 7898
better 7899
not 7900
do 7901
that 7902
again!” 7903
which 7904
produced 7905
another 7906
dead 7907
silence. 7908
Alice 7909
noticed 7910
with 7911
some 7912
surprise 7913
that 7914
the 7915
pebbles 7916
were 7917
all 7918
turning 7919
into 7920
little 7921
cakes 7922
as 7923
they 7924
lay 7925
on 7926
the 7927
floor, 7928
and 7929
a 7930
bright 7931
idea 7932
came 7933
into 7934
her 7935
head. 7936
“If 7937
I 7938
eat 7939
one 7940
of 7941
these 7942
cakes,” 7943
she 7944
thought, 7945
“it’s 7946
sure 7947
to 7948
make 7949
_some_ 7950
change 7951
in 7952
my 7953
size; 7954
and 7955
as 7956
it 7957
can’t 7958
possibly 7959
make 7960
me 7961
larger, 7962
it 7963
must 7964
make 7965
me 7966
smaller, 7967
I 7968
suppose.” 7969
So 7970
she 7971
swallowed 7972
one 7973
of 7974
the 7975
cakes, 7976
and 7977
was 7978
delighted 7979
to 7980
find 7981
that 7982
she 7983
began 7984
shrinking 7985
directly. 7986
As 7987
soon 7988
as 7989
she 7990
was 7991
small 7992
enough 7993
to 7994
get 7995
through 7996
the 7997
door, 7998
she 7999
ran 8000
out 8001
of 8002
the 8003
house, 8004
and 8005
found 8006
quite 8007
a 8008
crowd 8009
of 8010
little 8011
animals 8012
and 8013
birds 8014
waiting 8015
outside. 8016
The 8017
poor 8018
little 8019
Lizard, 8020
Bill, 8021
was 8022
in 8023
the 8024
middle, 8025
being 8026
held 8027
up 8028
by 8029
two 8030
guinea-pigs, 8031
who 8032
were 8033
giving 8034
it 8035
something 8036
out 8037
of 8038
a 8039
bottle. 8040
They 8041
all 8042
made 8043
a 8044
rush 8045
at 8046
Alice 8047
the 8048
moment 8049
she 8050
appeared; 8051
but 8052
she 8053
ran 8054
off 8055
as 8056
hard 8057
as 8058
she 8059
could, 8060
and 8061
soon 8062
found 8063
herself 8064
safe 8065
in 8066
a 8067
thick 8068
wood. 8069
“The 8070
first 8071
thing 8072
I’ve 8073
got 8074
to 8075
do,” 8076
said 8077
Alice 8078
to 8079
herself, 8080
as 8081
she 8082
wandered 8083
about 8084
in 8085
the 8086
wood, 8087
“is 8088
to 8089
grow 8090
to 8091
my 8092
right 8093
size 8094
again; 8095
and 8096
the 8097
second 8098
thing 8099
is 8100
to 8101
find 8102
my 8103
way 8104
into 8105
that 8106
lovely 8107
garden. 8108
I 8109
think 8110
that 8111
will 8112
be 8113
the 8114
best 8115
plan.” 8116
It 8117
sounded 8118
an 8119
excellent 8120
plan, 8121
no 8122
doubt, 8123
and 8124
very 8125
neatly 8126
and 8127
simply 8128
arranged; 8129
the 8130
only 8131
difficulty 8132
was, 8133
that 8134
she 8135
had 8136
not 8137
the 8138
smallest 8139
idea 8140
how 8141
to 8142
set 8143
about 8144
it; 8145
and 8146
while 8147
she 8148
was 8149
peering 8150
about 8151
anxiously 8152
among 8153
the 8154
trees, 8155
a 8156
little 8157
sharp 8158
bark 8159
just 8160
over 8161
her 8162
head 8163
made 8164
her 8165
look 8166
up 8167
in 8168
a 8169
great 8170
hurry. 8171
An 8172
enormous 8173
puppy 8174
was 8175
looking 8176
down 8177
at 8178
her 8179
with 8180
large 8181
round 8182
eyes, 8183
and 8184
feebly 8185
stretching 8186
out 8187
one 8188
paw, 8189
trying 8190
to 8191
touch 8192
her. 8193
“Poor 8194
little 8195
thing!” 8196
said 8197
Alice, 8198
in 8199
a 8200
coaxing 8201
tone, 8202
and 8203
she 8204
tried 8205
hard 8206
to 8207
whistle 8208
to 8209
it; 8210
but 8211
she 8212
was 8213
terribly 8214
frightened 8215
all 8216
the 8217
time 8218
at 8219
the 8220
thought 8221
that 8222
it 8223
might 8224
be 8225
hungry, 8226
in 8227
which 8228
case 8229
it 8230
would 8231
be 8232
very 8233
likely 8234
to 8235
eat 8236
her 8237
up 8238
in 8239
spite 8240
of 8241
all 8242
her 8243
coaxing. 8244
Hardly 8245
knowing 8246
what 8247
she 8248
did, 8249
she 8250
picked 8251
up 8252
a 8253
little 8254
bit 8255
of 8256
stick, 8257
and 8258
held 8259
it 8260
out 8261
to 8262
the 8263
puppy; 8264
whereupon 8265
the 8266
puppy 8267
jumped 8268
into 8269
the 8270
air 8271
off 8272
all 8273
its 8274
feet 8275
at 8276
once, 8277
with 8278
a 8279
yelp 8280
of 8281
delight, 8282
and 8283
rushed 8284
at 8285
the 8286
stick, 8287
and 8288
made 8289
believe 8290
to 8291
worry 8292
it; 8293
then 8294
Alice 8295
dodged 8296
behind 8297
a 8298
great 8299
thistle, 8300
to 8301
keep 8302
herself 8303
from 8304
being 8305
run 8306
over; 8307
and 8308
the 8309
moment 8310
she 8311
appeared 8312
on 8313
the 8314
other 8315
side, 8316
the 8317
puppy 8318
made 8319
another 8320
rush 8321
at 8322
the 8323
stick, 8324
and 8325
tumbled 8326
head 8327
over 8328
heels 8329
in 8330
its 8331
hurry 8332
to 8333
get 8334
hold 8335
of 8336
it; 8337
then 8338
Alice, 8339
thinking 8340
it 8341
was 8342
very 8343
like 8344
having 8345
a 8346
game 8347
of 8348
play 8349
with 8350
a 8351
cart-horse, 8352
and 8353
expecting 8354
every 8355
moment 8356
to 8357
be 8358
trampled 8359
under 8360
its 8361
feet, 8362
ran 8363
round 8364
the 8365
thistle 8366
again; 8367
then 8368
the 8369
puppy 8370
began 8371
a 8372
series 8373
of 8374
short 8375
charges 8376
at 8377
the 8378
stick, 8379
running 8380
a 8381
very 8382
little 8383
way 8384
forwards 8385
each 8386
time 8387
and 8388
a 8389
long 8390
way 8391
back, 8392
and 8393
barking 8394
hoarsely 8395
all 8396
the 8397
while, 8398
till 8399
at 8400
last 8401
it 8402
sat 8403
down 8404
a 8405
good 8406
way 8407
off, 8408
panting, 8409
with 8410
its 8411
tongue 8412
hanging 8413
out 8414
of 8415
its 8416
mouth, 8417
and 8418
its 8419
great 8420
eyes 8421
half 8422
shut. 8423
This 8424
seemed 8425
to 8426
Alice 8427
a 8428
good 8429
opportunity 8430
for 8431
making 8432
her 8433
escape; 8434
so 8435
she 8436
set 8437
off 8438
at 8439
once, 8440
and 8441
ran 8442
till 8443
she 8444
was 8445
quite 8446
tired 8447
and 8448
out 8449
of 8450
breath, 8451
and 8452
till 8453
the 8454
puppy’s 8455
bark 8456
sounded 8457
quite 8458
faint 8459
in 8460
the 8461
distance. 8462
“And 8463
yet 8464
what 8465
a 8466
dear 8467
little 8468
puppy 8469
it 8470
was!” 8471
said 8472
Alice, 8473
as 8474
she 8475
leant 8476
against 8477
a 8478
buttercup 8479
to 8480
rest 8481
herself, 8482
and 8483
fanned 8484
herself 8485
with 8486
one 8487
of 8488
the 8489
leaves: 8490
“I 8491
should 8492
have 8493
liked 8494
teaching 8495
it 8496
tricks 8497
very 8498
much, 8499
if—if 8500
I’d 8501
only 8502
been 8503
the 8504
right 8505
size 8506
to 8507
do 8508
it! 8509
Oh 8510
dear! 8511
I’d 8512
nearly 8513
forgotten 8514
that 8515
I’ve 8516
got 8517
to 8518
grow 8519
up 8520
again! 8521
Let 8522
me 8523
see—how 8524
_is_ 8525
it 8526
to 8527
be 8528
managed? 8529
I 8530
suppose 8531
I 8532
ought 8533
to 8534
eat 8535
or 8536
drink 8537
something 8538
or 8539
other; 8540
but 8541
the 8542
great 8543
question 8544
is, 8545
what?” 8546
The 8547
great 8548
question 8549
certainly 8550
was, 8551
what? 8552
Alice 8553
looked 8554
all 8555
round 8556
her 8557
at 8558
the 8559
flowers 8560
and 8561
the 8562
blades 8563
of 8564
grass, 8565
but 8566
she 8567
did 8568
not 8569
see 8570
anything 8571
that 8572
looked 8573
like 8574
the 8575
right 8576
thing 8577
to 8578
eat 8579
or 8580
drink 8581
under 8582
the 8583
circumstances. 8584
There 8585
was 8586
a 8587
large 8588
mushroom 8589
growing 8590
near 8591
her, 8592
about 8593
the 8594
same 8595
height 8596
as 8597
herself; 8598
and 8599
when 8600
she 8601
had 8602
looked 8603
under 8604
it, 8605
and 8606
on 8607
both 8608
sides 8609
of 8610
it, 8611
and 8612
behind 8613
it, 8614
it 8615
occurred 8616
to 8617
her 8618
that 8619
she 8620
might 8621
as 8622
well 8623
look 8624
and 8625
see 8626
what 8627
was 8628
on 8629
the 8630
top 8631
of 8632
it. 8633
She 8634
stretched 8635
herself 8636
up 8637
on 8638
tiptoe, 8639
and 8640
peeped 8641
over 8642
the 8643
edge 8644
of 8645
the 8646
mushroom, 8647
and 8648
her 8649
eyes 8650
immediately 8651
met 8652
those 8653
of 8654
a 8655
large 8656
blue 8657
caterpillar, 8658
that 8659
was 8660
sitting 8661
on 8662
the 8663
top 8664
with 8665
its 8666
arms 8667
folded, 8668
quietly 8669
smoking 8670
a 8671
long 8672
hookah, 8673
and 8674
taking 8675
not 8676
the 8677
smallest 8678
notice 8679
of 8680
her 8681
or 8682
of 8683
anything 8684
else. 8685
CHAPTER 8686
V. 8687
Advice 8688
from 8689
a 8690
Caterpillar 8691
The 8692
Caterpillar 8693
and 8694
Alice 8695
looked 8696
at 8697
each 8698
other 8699
for 8700
some 8701
time 8702
in 8703
silence: 8704
at 8705
last 8706
the 8707
Caterpillar 8708
took 8709
the 8710
hookah 8711
out 8712
of 8713
its 8714
mouth, 8715
and 8716
addressed 8717
her 8718
in 8719
a 8720
languid, 8721
sleepy 8722
voice. 8723
“Who 8724
are 8725
_you?_” 8726
said 8727
the 8728
Caterpillar. 8729
This 8730
was 8731
not 8732
an 8733
encouraging 8734
opening 8735
for 8736
a 8737
conversation. 8738
Alice 8739
replied, 8740
rather 8741
shyly, 8742
“I—I 8743
hardly 8744
know, 8745
sir, 8746
just 8747
at 8748
present—at 8749
least 8750
I 8751
know 8752
who 8753
I 8754
_was_ 8755
when 8756
I 8757
got 8758
up 8759
this 8760
morning, 8761
but 8762
I 8763
think 8764
I 8765
must 8766
have 8767
been 8768
changed 8769
several 8770
times 8771
since 8772
then.” 8773
“What 8774
do 8775
you 8776
mean 8777
by 8778
that?” 8779
said 8780
the 8781
Caterpillar 8782
sternly. 8783
“Explain 8784
yourself!” 8785
“I 8786
can’t 8787
explain 8788
_myself_, 8789
I’m 8790
afraid, 8791
sir,” 8792
said 8793
Alice, 8794
“because 8795
I’m 8796
not 8797
myself, 8798
you 8799
see.” 8800
“I 8801
don’t 8802
see,” 8803
said 8804
the 8805
Caterpillar. 8806
“I’m 8807
afraid 8808
I 8809
can’t 8810
put 8811
it 8812
more 8813
clearly,” 8814
Alice 8815
replied 8816
very 8817
politely, 8818
“for 8819
I 8820
can’t 8821
understand 8822
it 8823
myself 8824
to 8825
begin 8826
with; 8827
and 8828
being 8829
so 8830
many 8831
different 8832
sizes 8833
in 8834
a 8835
day 8836
is 8837
very 8838
confusing.” 8839
“It 8840
isn’t,” 8841
said 8842
the 8843
Caterpillar. 8844
“Well, 8845
perhaps 8846
you 8847
haven’t 8848
found 8849
it 8850
so 8851
yet,” 8852
said 8853
Alice; 8854
“but 8855
when 8856
you 8857
have 8858
to 8859
turn 8860
into 8861
a 8862
chrysalis—you 8863
will 8864
some 8865
day, 8866
you 8867
know—and 8868
then 8869
after 8870
that 8871
into 8872
a 8873
butterfly, 8874
I 8875
should 8876
think 8877
you’ll 8878
feel 8879
it 8880
a 8881
little 8882
queer, 8883
won’t 8884
you?” 8885
“Not 8886
a 8887
bit,” 8888
said 8889
the 8890
Caterpillar. 8891
“Well, 8892
perhaps 8893
your 8894
feelings 8895
may 8896
be 8897
different,” 8898
said 8899
Alice; 8900
“all 8901
I 8902
know 8903
is, 8904
it 8905
would 8906
feel 8907
very 8908
queer 8909
to 8910
_me_.” 8911
“You!” 8912
said 8913
the 8914
Caterpillar 8915
contemptuously. 8916
“Who 8917
are 8918
_you?_” 8919
Which 8920
brought 8921
them 8922
back 8923
again 8924
to 8925
the 8926
beginning 8927
of 8928
the 8929
conversation. 8930
Alice 8931
felt 8932
a 8933
little 8934
irritated 8935
at 8936
the 8937
Caterpillar’s 8938
making 8939
such 8940
_very_ 8941
short 8942
remarks, 8943
and 8944
she 8945
drew 8946
herself 8947
up 8948
and 8949
said, 8950
very 8951
gravely, 8952
“I 8953
think, 8954
you 8955
ought 8956
to 8957
tell 8958
me 8959
who 8960
_you_ 8961
are, 8962
first.” 8963
“Why?” 8964
said 8965
the 8966
Caterpillar. 8967
Here 8968
was 8969
another 8970
puzzling 8971
question; 8972
and 8973
as 8974
Alice 8975
could 8976
not 8977
think 8978
of 8979
any 8980
good 8981
reason, 8982
and 8983
as 8984
the 8985
Caterpillar 8986
seemed 8987
to 8988
be 8989
in 8990
a 8991
_very_ 8992
unpleasant 8993
state 8994
of 8995
mind, 8996
she 8997
turned 8998
away. 8999
“Come 9000
back!” 9001
the 9002
Caterpillar 9003
called 9004
after 9005
her. 9006
“I’ve 9007
something 9008
important 9009
to 9010
say!” 9011
This 9012
sounded 9013
promising, 9014
certainly: 9015
Alice 9016
turned 9017
and 9018
came 9019
back 9020
again. 9021
“Keep 9022
your 9023
temper,” 9024
said 9025
the 9026
Caterpillar. 9027
“Is 9028
that 9029
all?” 9030
said 9031
Alice, 9032
swallowing 9033
down 9034
her 9035
anger 9036
as 9037
well 9038
as 9039
she 9040
could. 9041
“No,” 9042
said 9043
the 9044
Caterpillar. 9045
Alice 9046
thought 9047
she 9048
might 9049
as 9050
well 9051
wait, 9052
as 9053
she 9054
had 9055
nothing 9056
else 9057
to 9058
do, 9059
and 9060
perhaps 9061
after 9062
all 9063
it 9064
might 9065
tell 9066
her 9067
something 9068
worth 9069
hearing. 9070
For 9071
some 9072
minutes 9073
it 9074
puffed 9075
away 9076
without 9077
speaking, 9078
but 9079
at 9080
last 9081
it 9082
unfolded 9083
its 9084
arms, 9085
took 9086
the 9087
hookah 9088
out 9089
of 9090
its 9091
mouth 9092
again, 9093
and 9094
said, 9095
“So 9096
you 9097
think 9098
you’re 9099
changed, 9100
do 9101
you?” 9102
“I’m 9103
afraid 9104
I 9105
am, 9106
sir,” 9107
said 9108
Alice; 9109
“I 9110
can’t 9111
remember 9112
things 9113
as 9114
I 9115
used—and 9116
I 9117
don’t 9118
keep 9119
the 9120
same 9121
size 9122
for 9123
ten 9124
minutes 9125
together!” 9126
“Can’t 9127
remember 9128
_what_ 9129
things?” 9130
said 9131
the 9132
Caterpillar. 9133
“Well, 9134
I’ve 9135
tried 9136
to 9137
say 9138
“How 9139
doth 9140
the 9141
little 9142
busy 9143
bee,” 9144
but 9145
it 9146
all 9147
came 9148
different!” 9149
Alice 9150
replied 9151
in 9152
a 9153
very 9154
melancholy 9155
voice. 9156
“Repeat, 9157
“_You 9158
are 9159
old, 9160
Father 9161
William_,’” 9162
said 9163
the 9164
Caterpillar. 9165
Alice 9166
folded 9167
her 9168
hands, 9169
and 9170
began:— 9171
“You 9172
are 9173
old, 9174
Father 9175
William,” 9176
the 9177
young 9178
man 9179
said, 9180
“And 9181
your 9182
hair 9183
has 9184
become 9185
very 9186
white; 9187
And 9188
yet 9189
you 9190
incessantly 9191
stand 9192
on 9193
your 9194
head— 9195
Do 9196
you 9197
think, 9198
at 9199
your 9200
age, 9201
it 9202
is 9203
right?” 9204
“In 9205
my 9206
youth,” 9207
Father 9208
William 9209
replied 9210
to 9211
his 9212
son, 9213
“I 9214
feared 9215
it 9216
might 9217
injure 9218
the 9219
brain; 9220
But, 9221
now 9222
that 9223
I’m 9224
perfectly 9225
sure 9226
I 9227
have 9228
none, 9229
Why, 9230
I 9231
do 9232
it 9233
again 9234
and 9235
again.” 9236
“You 9237
are 9238
old,” 9239
said 9240
the 9241
youth, 9242
“as 9243
I 9244
mentioned 9245
before, 9246
And 9247
have 9248
grown 9249
most 9250
uncommonly 9251
fat; 9252
Yet 9253
you 9254
turned 9255
a 9256
back-somersault 9257
in 9258
at 9259
the 9260
door— 9261
Pray, 9262
what 9263
is 9264
the 9265
reason 9266
of 9267
that?” 9268
“In 9269
my 9270
youth,” 9271
said 9272
the 9273
sage, 9274
as 9275
he 9276
shook 9277
his 9278
grey 9279
locks, 9280
“I 9281
kept 9282
all 9283
my 9284
limbs 9285
very 9286
supple 9287
By 9288
the 9289
use 9290
of 9291
this 9292
ointment—one 9293
shilling 9294
the 9295
box— 9296
Allow 9297
me 9298
to 9299
sell 9300
you 9301
a 9302
couple?” 9303
“You 9304
are 9305
old,” 9306
said 9307
the 9308
youth, 9309
“and 9310
your 9311
jaws 9312
are 9313
too 9314
weak 9315
For 9316
anything 9317
tougher 9318
than 9319
suet; 9320
Yet 9321
you 9322
finished 9323
the 9324
goose, 9325
with 9326
the 9327
bones 9328
and 9329
the 9330
beak— 9331
Pray, 9332
how 9333
did 9334
you 9335
manage 9336
to 9337
do 9338
it?” 9339
“In 9340
my 9341
youth,” 9342
said 9343
his 9344
father, 9345
“I 9346
took 9347
to 9348
the 9349
law, 9350
And 9351
argued 9352
each 9353
case 9354
with 9355
my 9356
wife; 9357
And 9358
the 9359
muscular 9360
strength, 9361
which 9362
it 9363
gave 9364
to 9365
my 9366
jaw, 9367
Has 9368
lasted 9369
the 9370
rest 9371
of 9372
my 9373
life.” 9374
“You 9375
are 9376
old,” 9377
said 9378
the 9379
youth, 9380
“one 9381
would 9382
hardly 9383
suppose 9384
That 9385
your 9386
eye 9387
was 9388
as 9389
steady 9390
as 9391
ever; 9392
Yet 9393
you 9394
balanced 9395
an 9396
eel 9397
on 9398
the 9399
end 9400
of 9401
your 9402
nose— 9403
What 9404
made 9405
you 9406
so 9407
awfully 9408
clever?” 9409
“I 9410
have 9411
answered 9412
three 9413
questions, 9414
and 9415
that 9416
is 9417
enough,” 9418
Said 9419
his 9420
father; 9421
“don’t 9422
give 9423
yourself 9424
airs! 9425
Do 9426
you 9427
think 9428
I 9429
can 9430
listen 9431
all 9432
day 9433
to 9434
such 9435
stuff? 9436
Be 9437
off, 9438
or 9439
I’ll 9440
kick 9441
you 9442
down 9443
stairs!” 9444
“That 9445
is 9446
not 9447
said 9448
right,” 9449
said 9450
the 9451
Caterpillar. 9452
“Not 9453
_quite_ 9454
right, 9455
I’m 9456
afraid,” 9457
said 9458
Alice, 9459
timidly; 9460
“some 9461
of 9462
the 9463
words 9464
have 9465
got 9466
altered.” 9467
“It 9468
is 9469
wrong 9470
from 9471
beginning 9472
to 9473
end,” 9474
said 9475
the 9476
Caterpillar 9477
decidedly, 9478
and 9479
there 9480
was 9481
silence 9482
for 9483
some 9484
minutes. 9485
The 9486
Caterpillar 9487
was 9488
the 9489
first 9490
to 9491
speak. 9492
“What 9493
size 9494
do 9495
you 9496
want 9497
to 9498
be?” 9499
it 9500
asked. 9501
“Oh, 9502
I’m 9503
not 9504
particular 9505
as 9506
to 9507
size,” 9508
Alice 9509
hastily 9510
replied; 9511
“only 9512
one 9513
doesn’t 9514
like 9515
changing 9516
so 9517
often, 9518
you 9519
know.” 9520
“I 9521
_don’t_ 9522
know,” 9523
said 9524
the 9525
Caterpillar. 9526
Alice 9527
said 9528
nothing: 9529
she 9530
had 9531
never 9532
been 9533
so 9534
much 9535
contradicted 9536
in 9537
her 9538
life 9539
before, 9540
and 9541
she 9542
felt 9543
that 9544
she 9545
was 9546
losing 9547
her 9548
temper. 9549
“Are 9550
you 9551
content 9552
now?” 9553
said 9554
the 9555
Caterpillar. 9556
“Well, 9557
I 9558
should 9559
like 9560
to 9561
be 9562
a 9563
_little_ 9564
larger, 9565
sir, 9566
if 9567
you 9568
wouldn’t 9569
mind,” 9570
said 9571
Alice: 9572
“three 9573
inches 9574
is 9575
such 9576
a 9577
wretched 9578
height 9579
to 9580
be.” 9581
“It 9582
is 9583
a 9584
very 9585
good 9586
height 9587
indeed!” 9588
said 9589
the 9590
Caterpillar 9591
angrily, 9592
rearing 9593
itself 9594
upright 9595
as 9596
it 9597
spoke 9598
(it 9599
was 9600
exactly 9601
three 9602
inches 9603
high). 9604
“But 9605
I’m 9606
not 9607
used 9608
to 9609
it!” 9610
pleaded 9611
poor 9612
Alice 9613
in 9614
a 9615
piteous 9616
tone. 9617
And 9618
she 9619
thought 9620
of 9621
herself, 9622
“I 9623
wish 9624
the 9625
creatures 9626
wouldn’t 9627
be 9628
so 9629
easily 9630
offended!” 9631
“You’ll 9632
get 9633
used 9634
to 9635
it 9636
in 9637
time,” 9638
said 9639
the 9640
Caterpillar; 9641
and 9642
it 9643
put 9644
the 9645
hookah 9646
into 9647
its 9648
mouth 9649
and 9650
began 9651
smoking 9652
again. 9653
This 9654
time 9655
Alice 9656
waited 9657
patiently 9658
until 9659
it 9660
chose 9661
to 9662
speak 9663
again. 9664
In 9665
a 9666
minute 9667
or 9668
two 9669
the 9670
Caterpillar 9671
took 9672
the 9673
hookah 9674
out 9675
of 9676
its 9677
mouth 9678
and 9679
yawned 9680
once 9681
or 9682
twice, 9683
and 9684
shook 9685
itself. 9686
Then 9687
it 9688
got 9689
down 9690
off 9691
the 9692
mushroom, 9693
and 9694
crawled 9695
away 9696
in 9697
the 9698
grass, 9699
merely 9700
remarking 9701
as 9702
it 9703
went, 9704
“One 9705
side 9706
will 9707
make 9708
you 9709
grow 9710
taller, 9711
and 9712
the 9713
other 9714
side 9715
will 9716
make 9717
you 9718
grow 9719
shorter.” 9720
“One 9721
side 9722
of 9723
_what?_ 9724
The 9725
other 9726
side 9727
of 9728
_what?_” 9729
thought 9730
Alice 9731
to 9732
herself. 9733
“Of 9734
the 9735
mushroom,” 9736
said 9737
the 9738
Caterpillar, 9739
just 9740
as 9741
if 9742
she 9743
had 9744
asked 9745
it 9746
aloud; 9747
and 9748
in 9749
another 9750
moment 9751
it 9752
was 9753
out 9754
of 9755
sight. 9756
Alice 9757
remained 9758
looking 9759
thoughtfully 9760
at 9761
the 9762
mushroom 9763
for 9764
a 9765
minute, 9766
trying 9767
to 9768
make 9769
out 9770
which 9771
were 9772
the 9773
two 9774
sides 9775
of 9776
it; 9777
and 9778
as 9779
it 9780
was 9781
perfectly 9782
round, 9783
she 9784
found 9785
this 9786
a 9787
very 9788
difficult 9789
question. 9790
However, 9791
at 9792
last 9793
she 9794
stretched 9795
her 9796
arms 9797
round 9798
it 9799
as 9800
far 9801
as 9802
they 9803
would 9804
go, 9805
and 9806
broke 9807
off 9808
a 9809
bit 9810
of 9811
the 9812
edge 9813
with 9814
each 9815
hand. 9816
“And 9817
now 9818
which 9819
is 9820
which?” 9821
she 9822
said 9823
to 9824
herself, 9825
and 9826
nibbled 9827
a 9828
little 9829
of 9830
the 9831
right-hand 9832
bit 9833
to 9834
try 9835
the 9836
effect: 9837
the 9838
next 9839
moment 9840
she 9841
felt 9842
a 9843
violent 9844
blow 9845
underneath 9846
her 9847
chin: 9848
it 9849
had 9850
struck 9851
her 9852
foot! 9853
She 9854
was 9855
a 9856
good 9857
deal 9858
frightened 9859
by 9860
this 9861
very 9862
sudden 9863
change, 9864
but 9865
she 9866
felt 9867
that 9868
there 9869
was 9870
no 9871
time 9872
to 9873
be 9874
lost, 9875
as 9876
she 9877
was 9878
shrinking 9879
rapidly; 9880
so 9881
she 9882
set 9883
to 9884
work 9885
at 9886
once 9887
to 9888
eat 9889
some 9890
of 9891
the 9892
other 9893
bit. 9894
Her 9895
chin 9896
was 9897
pressed 9898
so 9899
closely 9900
against 9901
her 9902
foot, 9903
that 9904
there 9905
was 9906
hardly 9907
room 9908
to 9909
open 9910
her 9911
mouth; 9912
but 9913
she 9914
did 9915
it 9916
at 9917
last, 9918
and 9919
managed 9920
to 9921
swallow 9922
a 9923
morsel 9924
of 9925
the 9926
lefthand 9927
bit. 9928

“Come, 9949
my 9950
head’s 9951
free 9952
at 9953
last!” 9954
said 9955
Alice 9956
in 9957
a 9958
tone 9959
of 9960
delight, 9961
which 9962
changed 9963
into 9964
alarm 9965
in 9966
another 9967
moment, 9968
when 9969
she 9970
found 9971
that 9972
her 9973
shoulders 9974
were 9975
nowhere 9976
to 9977
be 9978
found: 9979
all 9980
she 9981
could 9982
see, 9983
when 9984
she 9985
looked 9986
down, 9987
was 9988
an 9989
immense 9990
length 9991
of 9992
neck, 9993
which 9994
seemed 9995
to 9996
rise 9997
like 9998
a 9999
stalk 10000
out 10001
of 10002
a 10003
sea 10004
of 10005
green 10006
leaves 10007
that 10008
lay 10009
far 10010
below 10011
her. 10012
“What 10013
_can_ 10014
all 10015
that 10016
green 10017
stuff 10018
be?” 10019
said 10020
Alice. 10021
“And 10022
where 10023
_have_ 10024
my 10025
shoulders 10026
got 10027
to? 10028
And 10029
oh, 10030
my 10031
poor 10032
hands, 10033
how 10034
is 10035
it 10036
I 10037
can’t 10038
see 10039
you?” 10040
She 10041
was 10042
moving 10043
them 10044
about 10045
as 10046
she 10047
spoke, 10048
but 10049
no 10050
result 10051
seemed 10052
to 10053
follow, 10054
except 10055
a 10056
little 10057
shaking 10058
among 10059
the 10060
distant 10061
green 10062
leaves. 10063
As 10064
there 10065
seemed 10066
to 10067
be 10068
no 10069
chance 10070
of 10071
getting 10072
her 10073
hands 10074
up 10075
to 10076
her 10077
head, 10078
she 10079
tried 10080
to 10081
get 10082
her 10083
head 10084
down 10085
to 10086
them, 10087
and 10088
was 10089
delighted 10090
to 10091
find 10092
that 10093
her 10094
neck 10095
would 10096
bend 10097
about 10098
easily 10099
in 10100
any 10101
direction, 10102
like 10103
a 10104
serpent. 10105
She 10106
had 10107
just 10108
succeeded 10109
in 10110
curving 10111
it 10112
down 10113
into 10114
a 10115
graceful 10116
zigzag, 10117
and 10118
was 10119
going 10120
to 10121
dive 10122
in 10123
among 10124
the 10125
leaves, 10126
which 10127
she 10128
found 10129
to 10130
be 10131
nothing 10132
but 10133
the 10134
tops 10135
of 10136
the 10137
trees 10138
under 10139
which 10140
she 10141
had 10142
been 10143
wandering, 10144
when 10145
a 10146
sharp 10147
hiss 10148
made 10149
her 10150
draw 10151
back 10152
in 10153
a 10154
hurry: 10155
a 10156
large 10157
pigeon 10158
had 10159
flown 10160
into 10161
her 10162
face, 10163
and 10164
was 10165
beating 10166
her 10167
violently 10168
with 10169
its 10170
wings. 10171
“Serpent!” 10172
screamed 10173
the 10174
Pigeon. 10175
“I’m 10176
_not_ 10177
a 10178
serpent!” 10179
said 10180
Alice 10181
indignantly. 10182
“Let 10183
me 10184
alone!” 10185
“Serpent, 10186
I 10187
say 10188
again!” 10189
repeated 10190
the 10191
Pigeon, 10192
but 10193
in 10194
a 10195
more 10196
subdued 10197
tone, 10198
and 10199
added 10200
with 10201
a 10202
kind 10203
of 10204
sob, 10205
“I’ve 10206
tried 10207
every 10208
way, 10209
and 10210
nothing 10211
seems 10212
to 10213
suit 10214
them!” 10215
“I 10216
haven’t 10217
the 10218
least 10219
idea 10220
what 10221
you’re 10222
talking 10223
about,” 10224
said 10225
Alice. 10226
“I’ve 10227
tried 10228
the 10229
roots 10230
of 10231
trees, 10232
and 10233
I’ve 10234
tried 10235
banks, 10236
and 10237
I’ve 10238
tried 10239
hedges,” 10240
the 10241
Pigeon 10242
went 10243
on, 10244
without 10245
attending 10246
to 10247
her; 10248
“but 10249
those 10250
serpents! 10251
There’s 10252
no 10253
pleasing 10254
them!” 10255
Alice 10256
was 10257
more 10258
and 10259
more 10260
puzzled, 10261
but 10262
she 10263
thought 10264
there 10265
was 10266
no 10267
use 10268
in 10269
saying 10270
anything 10271
more 10272
till 10273
the 10274
Pigeon 10275
had 10276
finished. 10277
“As 10278
if 10279
it 10280
wasn’t 10281
trouble 10282
enough 10283
hatching 10284
the 10285
eggs,” 10286
said 10287
the 10288
Pigeon; 10289
“but 10290
I 10291
must 10292
be 10293
on 10294
the 10295
look-out 10296
for 10297
serpents 10298
night 10299
and 10300
day! 10301
Why, 10302
I 10303
haven’t 10304
had 10305
a 10306
wink 10307
of 10308
sleep 10309
these 10310
three 10311
weeks!” 10312
“I’m 10313
very 10314
sorry 10315
you’ve 10316
been 10317
annoyed,” 10318
said 10319
Alice, 10320
who 10321
was 10322
beginning 10323
to 10324
see 10325
its 10326
meaning. 10327
“And 10328
just 10329
as 10330
I’d 10331
taken 10332
the 10333
highest 10334
tree 10335
in 10336
the 10337
wood,” 10338
continued 10339
the 10340
Pigeon, 10341
raising 10342
its 10343
voice 10344
to 10345
a 10346
shriek, 10347
“and 10348
just 10349
as 10350
I 10351
was 10352
thinking 10353
I 10354
should 10355
be 10356
free 10357
of 10358
them 10359
at 10360
last, 10361
they 10362
must 10363
needs 10364
come 10365
wriggling 10366
down 10367
from 10368
the 10369
sky! 10370
Ugh, 10371
Serpent!” 10372
“But 10373
I’m 10374
_not_ 10375
a 10376
serpent, 10377
I 10378
tell 10379
you!” 10380
said 10381
Alice. 10382
“I’m 10383
a—I’m 10384
a—” 10385
“Well! 10386
_What_ 10387
are 10388
you?” 10389
said 10390
the 10391
Pigeon. 10392
“I 10393
can 10394
see 10395
you’re 10396
trying 10397
to 10398
invent 10399
something!” 10400
“I—I’m 10401
a 10402
little 10403
girl,” 10404
said 10405
Alice, 10406
rather 10407
doubtfully, 10408
as 10409
she 10410
remembered 10411
the 10412
number 10413
of 10414
changes 10415
she 10416
had 10417
gone 10418
through 10419
that 10420
day. 10421
“A 10422
likely 10423
story 10424
indeed!” 10425
said 10426
the 10427
Pigeon 10428
in 10429
a 10430
tone 10431
of 10432
the 10433
deepest 10434
contempt. 10435
“I’ve 10436
seen 10437
a 10438
good 10439
many 10440
little 10441
girls 10442
in 10443
my 10444
time, 10445
but 10446
never 10447
_one_ 10448
with 10449
such 10450
a 10451
neck 10452
as 10453
that! 10454
No, 10455
no! 10456
You’re 10457
a 10458
serpent; 10459
and 10460
there’s 10461
no 10462
use 10463
denying 10464
it. 10465
I 10466
suppose 10467
you’ll 10468
be 10469
telling 10470
me 10471
next 10472
that 10473
you 10474
never 10475
tasted 10476
an 10477
egg!” 10478
“I 10479
_have_ 10480
tasted 10481
eggs, 10482
certainly,” 10483
said 10484
Alice, 10485
who 10486
was 10487
a 10488
very 10489
truthful 10490
child; 10491
“but 10492
little 10493
girls 10494
eat 10495
eggs 10496
quite 10497
as 10498
much 10499
as 10500
serpents 10501
do, 10502
you 10503
know.” 10504
“I 10505
don’t 10506
believe 10507
it,” 10508
said 10509
the 10510
Pigeon; 10511
“but 10512
if 10513
they 10514
do, 10515
why 10516
then 10517
they’re 10518
a 10519
kind 10520
of 10521
serpent, 10522
that’s 10523
all 10524
I 10525
can 10526
say.” 10527
This 10528
was 10529
such 10530
a 10531
new 10532
idea 10533
to 10534
Alice, 10535
that 10536
she 10537
was 10538
quite 10539
silent 10540
for 10541
a 10542
minute 10543
or 10544
two, 10545
which 10546
gave 10547
the 10548
Pigeon 10549
the 10550
opportunity 10551
of 10552
adding, 10553
“You’re 10554
looking 10555
for 10556
eggs, 10557
I 10558
know 10559
_that_ 10560
well 10561
enough; 10562
and 10563
what 10564
does 10565
it 10566
matter 10567
to 10568
me 10569
whether 10570
you’re 10571
a 10572
little 10573
girl 10574
or 10575
a 10576
serpent?” 10577
“It 10578
matters 10579
a 10580
good 10581
deal 10582
to 10583
_me_,” 10584
said 10585
Alice 10586
hastily; 10587
“but 10588
I’m 10589
not 10590
looking 10591
for 10592
eggs, 10593
as 10594
it 10595
happens; 10596
and 10597
if 10598
I 10599
was, 10600
I 10601
shouldn’t 10602
want 10603
_yours_: 10604
I 10605
don’t 10606
like 10607
them 10608
raw.” 10609
“Well, 10610
be 10611
off, 10612
then!” 10613
said 10614
the 10615
Pigeon 10616
in 10617
a 10618
sulky 10619
tone, 10620
as 10621
it 10622
settled 10623
down 10624
again 10625
into 10626
its 10627
nest. 10628
Alice 10629
crouched 10630
down 10631
among 10632
the 10633
trees 10634
as 10635
well 10636
as 10637
she 10638
could, 10639
for 10640
her 10641
neck 10642
kept 10643
getting 10644
entangled 10645
among 10646
the 10647
branches, 10648
and 10649
every 10650
now 10651
and 10652
then 10653
she 10654
had 10655
to 10656
stop 10657
and 10658
untwist 10659
it. 10660
After 10661
a 10662
while 10663
she 10664
remembered 10665
that 10666
she 10667
still 10668
held 10669
the 10670
pieces 10671
of 10672
mushroom 10673
in 10674
her 10675
hands, 10676
and 10677
she 10678
set 10679
to 10680
work 10681
very 10682
carefully, 10683
nibbling 10684
first 10685
at 10686
one 10687
and 10688
then 10689
at 10690
the 10691
other, 10692
and 10693
growing 10694
sometimes 10695
taller 10696
and 10697
sometimes 10698
shorter, 10699
until 10700
she 10701
had 10702
succeeded 10703
in 10704
bringing 10705
herself 10706
down 10707
to 10708
her 10709
usual 10710
height. 10711
It 10712
was 10713
so 10714
long 10715
since 10716
she 10717
had 10718
been 10719
anything 10720
near 10721
the 10722
right 10723
size, 10724
that 10725
it 10726
felt 10727
quite 10728
strange 10729
at 10730
first; 10731
but 10732
she 10733
got 10734
used 10735
to 10736
it 10737
in 10738
a 10739
few 10740
minutes, 10741
and 10742
began 10743
talking 10744
to 10745
herself, 10746
as 10747
usual. 10748
“Come, 10749
there’s 10750
half 10751
my 10752
plan 10753
done 10754
now! 10755
How 10756
puzzling 10757
all 10758
these 10759
changes 10760
are! 10761
I’m 10762
never 10763
sure 10764
what 10765
I’m 10766
going 10767
to 10768
be, 10769
from 10770
one 10771
minute 10772
to 10773
another! 10774
However, 10775
I’ve 10776
got 10777
back 10778
to 10779
my 10780
right 10781
size: 10782
the 10783
next 10784
thing 10785
is, 10786
to 10787
get 10788
into 10789
that 10790
beautiful 10791
garden—how 10792
_is_ 10793
that 10794
to 10795
be 10796
done, 10797
I 10798
wonder?” 10799
As 10800
she 10801
said 10802
this, 10803
she 10804
came 10805
suddenly 10806
upon 10807
an 10808
open 10809
place, 10810
with 10811
a 10812
little 10813
house 10814
in 10815
it 10816
about 10817
four 10818
feet 10819
high. 10820
“Whoever 10821
lives 10822
there,” 10823
thought 10824
Alice, 10825
“it’ll 10826
never 10827
do 10828
to 10829
come 10830
upon 10831
them 10832
_this_ 10833
size: 10834
why, 10835
I 10836
should 10837
frighten 10838
them 10839
out 10840
of 10841
their 10842
wits!” 10843
So 10844
she 10845
began 10846
nibbling 10847
at 10848
the 10849
righthand 10850
bit 10851
again, 10852
and 10853
did 10854
not 10855
venture 10856
to 10857
go 10858
near 10859
the 10860
house 10861
till 10862
she 10863
had 10864
brought 10865
herself 10866
down 10867
to 10868
nine 10869
inches 10870
high. 10871
CHAPTER 10872
VI. 10873
Pig 10874
and 10875
Pepper 10876
For 10877
a 10878
minute 10879
or 10880
two 10881
she 10882
stood 10883
looking 10884
at 10885
the 10886
house, 10887
and 10888
wondering 10889
what 10890
to 10891
do 10892
next, 10893
when 10894
suddenly 10895
a 10896
footman 10897
in 10898
livery 10899
came 10900
running 10901
out 10902
of 10903
the 10904
wood—(she 10905
considered 10906
him 10907
to 10908
be 10909
a 10910
footman 10911
because 10912
he 10913
was 10914
in 10915
livery: 10916
otherwise, 10917
judging 10918
by 10919
his 10920
face 10921
only, 10922
she 10923
would 10924
have 10925
called 10926
him 10927
a 10928
fish)—and 10929
rapped 10930
loudly 10931
at 10932
the 10933
door 10934
with 10935
his 10936
knuckles. 10937
It 10938
was 10939
opened 10940
by 10941
another 10942
footman 10943
in 10944
livery, 10945
with 10946
a 10947
round 10948
face, 10949
and 10950
large 10951
eyes 10952
like 10953
a 10954
frog; 10955
and 10956
both 10957
footmen, 10958
Alice 10959
noticed, 10960
had 10961
powdered 10962
hair 10963
that 10964
curled 10965
all 10966
over 10967
their 10968
heads. 10969
She 10970
felt 10971
very 10972
curious 10973
to 10974
know 10975
what 10976
it 10977
was 10978
all 10979
about, 10980
and 10981
crept 10982
a 10983
little 10984
way 10985
out 10986
of 10987
the 10988
wood 10989
to 10990
listen. 10991
The 10992
Fish-Footman 10993
began 10994
by 10995
producing 10996
from 10997
under 10998
his 10999
arm 11000
a 11001
great 11002
letter, 11003
nearly 11004
as 11005
large 11006
as 11007
himself, 11008
and 11009
this 11010
he 11011
handed 11012
over 11013
to 11014
the 11015
other, 11016
saying, 11017
in 11018
a 11019
solemn 11020
tone, 11021
“For 11022
the 11023
Duchess. 11024
An 11025
invitation 11026
from 11027
the 11028
Queen 11029
to 11030
play 11031
croquet.” 11032
The 11033
Frog-Footman 11034
repeated, 11035
in 11036
the 11037
same 11038
solemn 11039
tone, 11040
only 11041
changing 11042
the 11043
order 11044
of 11045
the 11046
words 11047
a 11048
little, 11049
“From 11050
the 11051
Queen. 11052
An 11053
invitation 11054
for 11055
the 11056
Duchess 11057
to 11058
play 11059
croquet.” 11060
Then 11061
they 11062
both 11063
bowed 11064
low, 11065
and 11066
their 11067
curls 11068
got 11069
entangled 11070
together. 11071
Alice 11072
laughed 11073
so 11074
much 11075
at 11076
this, 11077
that 11078
she 11079
had 11080
to 11081
run 11082
back 11083
into 11084
the 11085
wood 11086
for 11087
fear 11088
of 11089
their 11090
hearing 11091
her; 11092
and 11093
when 11094
she 11095
next 11096
peeped 11097
out 11098
the 11099
Fish-Footman 11100
was 11101
gone, 11102
and 11103
the 11104
other 11105
was 11106
sitting 11107
on 11108
the 11109
ground 11110
near 11111
the 11112
door, 11113
staring 11114
stupidly 11115
up 11116
into 11117
the 11118
sky. 11119
Alice 11120
went 11121
timidly 11122
up 11123
to 11124
the 11125
door, 11126
and 11127
knocked. 11128
“There’s 11129
no 11130
sort 11131
of 11132
use 11133
in 11134
knocking,” 11135
said 11136
the 11137
Footman, 11138
“and 11139
that 11140
for 11141
two 11142
reasons. 11143
First, 11144
because 11145
I’m 11146
on 11147
the 11148
same 11149
side 11150
of 11151
the 11152
door 11153
as 11154
you 11155
are; 11156
secondly, 11157
because 11158
they’re 11159
making 11160
such 11161
a 11162
noise 11163
inside, 11164
no 11165
one 11166
could 11167
possibly 11168
hear 11169
you.” 11170
And 11171
certainly 11172
there 11173
_was_ 11174
a 11175
most 11176
extraordinary 11177
noise 11178
going 11179
on 11180
within—a 11181
constant 11182
howling 11183
and 11184
sneezing, 11185
and 11186
every 11187
now 11188
and 11189
then 11190
a 11191
great 11192
crash, 11193
as 11194
if 11195
a 11196
dish 11197
or 11198
kettle 11199
had 11200
been 11201
broken 11202
to 11203
pieces. 11204
“Please, 11205
then,” 11206
said 11207
Alice, 11208
“how 11209
am 11210
I 11211
to 11212
get 11213
in?” 11214
“There 11215
might 11216
be 11217
some 11218
sense 11219
in 11220
your 11221
knocking,” 11222
the 11223
Footman 11224
went 11225
on 11226
without 11227
attending 11228
to 11229
her, 11230
“if 11231
we 11232
had 11233
the 11234
door 11235
between 11236
us. 11237
For 11238
instance, 11239
if 11240
you 11241
were 11242
_inside_, 11243
you 11244
might 11245
knock, 11246
and 11247
I 11248
could 11249
let 11250
you 11251
out, 11252
you 11253
know.” 11254
He 11255
was 11256
looking 11257
up 11258
into 11259
the 11260
sky 11261
all 11262
the 11263
time 11264
he 11265
was 11266
speaking, 11267
and 11268
this 11269
Alice 11270
thought 11271
decidedly 11272
uncivil. 11273
“But 11274
perhaps 11275
he 11276
can’t 11277
help 11278
it,” 11279
she 11280
said 11281
to 11282
herself; 11283
“his 11284
eyes 11285
are 11286
so 11287
_very_ 11288
nearly 11289
at 11290
the 11291
top 11292
of 11293
his 11294
head. 11295
But 11296
at 11297
any 11298
rate 11299
he 11300
might 11301
answer 11302
questions.—How 11303
am 11304
I 11305
to 11306
get 11307
in?” 11308
she 11309
repeated, 11310
aloud. 11311
“I 11312
shall 11313
sit 11314
here,” 11315
the 11316
Footman 11317
remarked, 11318
“till 11319
tomorrow—” 11320
At 11321
this 11322
moment 11323
the 11324
door 11325
of 11326
the 11327
house 11328
opened, 11329
and 11330
a 11331
large 11332
plate 11333
came 11334
skimming 11335
out, 11336
straight 11337
at 11338
the 11339
Footman’s 11340
head: 11341
it 11342
just 11343
grazed 11344
his 11345
nose, 11346
and 11347
broke 11348
to 11349
pieces 11350
against 11351
one 11352
of 11353
the 11354
trees 11355
behind 11356
him. 11357
“—or 11358
next 11359
day, 11360
maybe,” 11361
the 11362
Footman 11363
continued 11364
in 11365
the 11366
same 11367
tone, 11368
exactly 11369
as 11370
if 11371
nothing 11372
had 11373
happened. 11374
“How 11375
am 11376
I 11377
to 11378
get 11379
in?” 11380
asked 11381
Alice 11382
again, 11383
in 11384
a 11385
louder 11386
tone. 11387
“_Are_ 11388
you 11389
to 11390
get 11391
in 11392
at 11393
all?” 11394
said 11395
the 11396
Footman. 11397
“That’s 11398
the 11399
first 11400
question, 11401
you 11402
know.” 11403
It 11404
was, 11405
no 11406
doubt: 11407
only 11408
Alice 11409
did 11410
not 11411
like 11412
to 11413
be 11414
told 11415
so. 11416
“It’s 11417
really 11418
dreadful,” 11419
she 11420
muttered 11421
to 11422
herself, 11423
“the 11424
way 11425
all 11426
the 11427
creatures 11428
argue. 11429
It’s 11430
enough 11431
to 11432
drive 11433
one 11434
crazy!” 11435
The 11436
Footman 11437
seemed 11438
to 11439
think 11440
this 11441
a 11442
good 11443
opportunity 11444
for 11445
repeating 11446
his 11447
remark, 11448
with 11449
variations. 11450
“I 11451
shall 11452
sit 11453
here,” 11454
he 11455
said, 11456
“on 11457
and 11458
off, 11459
for 11460
days 11461
and 11462
days.” 11463
“But 11464
what 11465
am 11466
_I_ 11467
to 11468
do?” 11469
said 11470
Alice. 11471
“Anything 11472
you 11473
like,” 11474
said 11475
the 11476
Footman, 11477
and 11478
began 11479
whistling. 11480
“Oh, 11481
there’s 11482
no 11483
use 11484
in 11485
talking 11486
to 11487
him,” 11488
said 11489
Alice 11490
desperately: 11491
“he’s 11492
perfectly 11493
idiotic!” 11494
And 11495
she 11496
opened 11497
the 11498
door 11499
and 11500
went 11501
in. 11502
The 11503
door 11504
led 11505
right 11506
into 11507
a 11508
large 11509
kitchen, 11510
which 11511
was 11512
full 11513
of 11514
smoke 11515
from 11516
one 11517
end 11518
to 11519
the 11520
other: 11521
the 11522
Duchess 11523
was 11524
sitting 11525
on 11526
a 11527
three-legged 11528
stool 11529
in 11530
the 11531
middle, 11532
nursing 11533
a 11534
baby; 11535
the 11536
cook 11537
was 11538
leaning 11539
over 11540
the 11541
fire, 11542
stirring 11543
a 11544
large 11545
cauldron 11546
which 11547
seemed 11548
to 11549
be 11550
full 11551
of 11552
soup. 11553
“There’s 11554
certainly 11555
too 11556
much 11557
pepper 11558
in 11559
that 11560
soup!” 11561
Alice 11562
said 11563
to 11564
herself, 11565
as 11566
well 11567
as 11568
she 11569
could 11570
for 11571
sneezing. 11572
There 11573
was 11574
certainly 11575
too 11576
much 11577
of 11578
it 11579
in 11580
the 11581
air. 11582
Even 11583
the 11584
Duchess 11585
sneezed 11586
occasionally; 11587
and 11588
as 11589
for 11590
the 11591
baby, 11592
it 11593
was 11594
sneezing 11595
and 11596
howling 11597
alternately 11598
without 11599
a 11600
moment’s 11601
pause. 11602
The 11603
only 11604
things 11605
in 11606
the 11607
kitchen 11608
that 11609
did 11610
not 11611
sneeze, 11612
were 11613
the 11614
cook, 11615
and 11616
a 11617
large 11618
cat 11619
which 11620
was 11621
sitting 11622
on 11623
the 11624
hearth 11625
and 11626
grinning 11627
from 11628
ear 11629
to 11630
ear. 11631
“Please 11632
would 11633
you 11634
tell 11635
me,” 11636
said 11637
Alice, 11638
a 11639
little 11640
timidly, 11641
for 11642
she 11643
was 11644
not 11645
quite 11646
sure 11647
whether 11648
it 11649
was 11650
good 11651
manners 11652
for 11653
her 11654
to 11655
speak 11656
first, 11657
“why 11658
your 11659
cat 11660
grins 11661
like 11662
that?” 11663
“It’s 11664
a 11665
Cheshire 11666
cat,” 11667
said 11668
the 11669
Duchess, 11670
“and 11671
that’s 11672
why. 11673
Pig!” 11674
She 11675
said 11676
the 11677
last 11678
word 11679
with 11680
such 11681
sudden 11682
violence 11683
that 11684
Alice 11685
quite 11686
jumped; 11687
but 11688
she 11689
saw 11690
in 11691
another 11692
moment 11693
that 11694
it 11695
was 11696
addressed 11697
to 11698
the 11699
baby, 11700
and 11701
not 11702
to 11703
her, 11704
so 11705
she 11706
took 11707
courage, 11708
and 11709
went 11710
on 11711
again:— 11712
“I 11713
didn’t 11714
know 11715
that 11716
Cheshire 11717
cats 11718
always 11719
grinned; 11720
in 11721
fact, 11722
I 11723
didn’t 11724
know 11725
that 11726
cats 11727
_could_ 11728
grin.” 11729
“They 11730
all 11731
can,” 11732
said 11733
the 11734
Duchess; 11735
“and 11736
most 11737
of 11738
’em 11739
do.” 11740
“I 11741
don’t 11742
know 11743
of 11744
any 11745
that 11746
do,” 11747
Alice 11748
said 11749
very 11750
politely, 11751
feeling 11752
quite 11753
pleased 11754
to 11755
have 11756
got 11757
into 11758
a 11759
conversation. 11760
“You 11761
don’t 11762
know 11763
much,” 11764
said 11765
the 11766
Duchess; 11767
“and 11768
that’s 11769
a 11770
fact.” 11771
Alice 11772
did 11773
not 11774
at 11775
all 11776
like 11777
the 11778
tone 11779
of 11780
this 11781
remark, 11782
and 11783
thought 11784
it 11785
would 11786
be 11787
as 11788
well 11789
to 11790
introduce 11791
some 11792
other 11793
subject 11794
of 11795
conversation. 11796
While 11797
she 11798
was 11799
trying 11800
to 11801
fix 11802
on 11803
one, 11804
the 11805
cook 11806
took 11807
the 11808
cauldron 11809
of 11810
soup 11811
off 11812
the 11813
fire, 11814
and 11815
at 11816
once 11817
set 11818
to 11819
work 11820
throwing 11821
everything 11822
within 11823
her 11824
reach 11825
at 11826
the 11827
Duchess 11828
and 11829
the 11830
baby—the 11831
fire-irons 11832
came 11833
first; 11834
then 11835
followed 11836
a 11837
shower 11838
of 11839
saucepans, 11840
plates, 11841
and 11842
dishes. 11843
The 11844
Duchess 11845
took 11846
no 11847
notice 11848
of 11849
them 11850
even 11851
when 11852
they 11853
hit 11854
her; 11855
and 11856
the 11857
baby 11858
was 11859
howling 11860
so 11861
much 11862
already, 11863
that 11864
it 11865
was 11866
quite 11867
impossible 11868
to 11869
say 11870
whether 11871
the 11872
blows 11873
hurt 11874
it 11875
or 11876
not. 11877
“Oh, 11878
_please_ 11879
mind 11880
what 11881
you’re 11882
doing!” 11883
cried 11884
Alice, 11885
jumping 11886
up 11887
and 11888
down 11889
in 11890
an 11891
agony 11892
of 11893
terror. 11894
“Oh, 11895
there 11896
goes 11897
his 11898
_precious_ 11899
nose!” 11900
as 11901
an 11902
unusually 11903
large 11904
saucepan 11905
flew 11906
close 11907
by 11908
it, 11909
and 11910
very 11911
nearly 11912
carried 11913
it 11914
off. 11915
“If 11916
everybody 11917
minded 11918
their 11919
own 11920
business,” 11921
the 11922
Duchess 11923
said 11924
in 11925
a 11926
hoarse 11927
growl, 11928
“the 11929
world 11930
would 11931
go 11932
round 11933
a 11934
deal 11935
faster 11936
than 11937
it 11938
does.” 11939
“Which 11940
would 11941
_not_ 11942
be 11943
an 11944
advantage,” 11945
said 11946
Alice, 11947
who 11948
felt 11949
very 11950
glad 11951
to 11952
get 11953
an 11954
opportunity 11955
of 11956
showing 11957
off 11958
a 11959
little 11960
of 11961
her 11962
knowledge. 11963
“Just 11964
think 11965
of 11966
what 11967
work 11968
it 11969
would 11970
make 11971
with 11972
the 11973
day 11974
and 11975
night! 11976
You 11977
see 11978
the 11979
earth 11980
takes 11981
twenty-four 11982
hours 11983
to 11984
turn 11985
round 11986
on 11987
its 11988
axis—” 11989
“Talking 11990
of 11991
axes,” 11992
said 11993
the 11994
Duchess, 11995
“chop 11996
off 11997
her 11998
head!” 11999
Alice 12000
glanced 12001
rather 12002
anxiously 12003
at 12004
the 12005
cook, 12006
to 12007
see 12008
if 12009
she 12010
meant 12011
to 12012
take 12013
the 12014
hint; 12015
but 12016
the 12017
cook 12018
was 12019
busily 12020
stirring 12021
the 12022
soup, 12023
and 12024
seemed 12025
not 12026
to 12027
be 12028
listening, 12029
so 12030
she 12031
went 12032
on 12033
again: 12034
“Twenty-four 12035
hours, 12036
I 12037
_think_; 12038
or 12039
is 12040
it 12041
twelve? 12042
I—” 12043
“Oh, 12044
don’t 12045
bother 12046
_me_,” 12047
said 12048
the 12049
Duchess; 12050
“I 12051
never 12052
could 12053
abide 12054
figures!” 12055
And 12056
with 12057
that 12058
she 12059
began 12060
nursing 12061
her 12062
child 12063
again, 12064
singing 12065
a 12066
sort 12067
of 12068
lullaby 12069
to 12070
it 12071
as 12072
she 12073
did 12074
so, 12075
and 12076
giving 12077
it 12078
a 12079
violent 12080
shake 12081
at 12082
the 12083
end 12084
of 12085
every 12086
line: 12087
“Speak 12088
roughly 12089
to 12090
your 12091
little 12092
boy, 12093
And 12094
beat 12095
him 12096
when 12097
he 12098
sneezes: 12099
He 12100
only 12101
does 12102
it 12103
to 12104
annoy, 12105
Because 12106
he 12107
knows 12108
it 12109
teases.” 12110
CHORUS. 12111
(In 12112
which 12113
the 12114
cook 12115
and 12116
the 12117
baby 12118
joined): 12119
“Wow! 12120
wow! 12121
wow!” 12122
While 12123
the 12124
Duchess 12125
sang 12126
the 12127
second 12128
verse 12129
of 12130
the 12131
song, 12132
she 12133
kept 12134
tossing 12135
the 12136
baby 12137
violently 12138
up 12139
and 12140
down, 12141
and 12142
the 12143
poor 12144
little 12145
thing 12146
howled 12147
so, 12148
that 12149
Alice 12150
could 12151
hardly 12152
hear 12153
the 12154
words:— 12155
“I 12156
speak 12157
severely 12158
to 12159
my 12160
boy, 12161
I 12162
beat 12163
him 12164
when 12165
he 12166
sneezes; 12167
For 12168
he 12169
can 12170
thoroughly 12171
enjoy 12172
The 12173
pepper 12174
when 12175
he 12176
pleases!” 12177
CHORUS. 12178
“Wow! 12179
wow! 12180
wow!” 12181
“Here! 12182
you 12183
may 12184
nurse 12185
it 12186
a 12187
bit, 12188
if 12189
you 12190
like!” 12191
the 12192
Duchess 12193
said 12194
to 12195
Alice, 12196
flinging 12197
the 12198
baby 12199
at 12200
her 12201
as 12202
she 12203
spoke. 12204
“I 12205
must 12206
go 12207
and 12208
get 12209
ready 12210
to 12211
play 12212
croquet 12213
with 12214
the 12215
Queen,” 12216
and 12217
she 12218
hurried 12219
out 12220
of 12221
the 12222
room. 12223
The 12224
cook 12225
threw 12226
a 12227
frying-pan 12228
after 12229
her 12230
as 12231
she 12232
went 12233
out, 12234
but 12235
it 12236
just 12237
missed 12238
her. 12239
Alice 12240
caught 12241
the 12242
baby 12243
with 12244
some 12245
difficulty, 12246
as 12247
it 12248
was 12249
a 12250
queer-shaped 12251
little 12252
creature, 12253
and 12254
held 12255
out 12256
its 12257
arms 12258
and 12259
legs 12260
in 12261
all 12262
directions, 12263
“just 12264
like 12265
a 12266
star-fish,” 12267
thought 12268
Alice. 12269
The 12270
poor 12271
little 12272
thing 12273
was 12274
snorting 12275
like 12276
a 12277
steam-engine 12278
when 12279
she 12280
caught 12281
it, 12282
and 12283
kept 12284
doubling 12285
itself 12286
up 12287
and 12288
straightening 12289
itself 12290
out 12291
again, 12292
so 12293
that 12294
altogether, 12295
for 12296
the 12297
first 12298
minute 12299
or 12300
two, 12301
it 12302
was 12303
as 12304
much 12305
as 12306
she 12307
could 12308
do 12309
to 12310
hold 12311
it. 12312
As 12313
soon 12314
as 12315
she 12316
had 12317
made 12318
out 12319
the 12320
proper 12321
way 12322
of 12323
nursing 12324
it, 12325
(which 12326
was 12327
to 12328
twist 12329
it 12330
up 12331
into 12332
a 12333
sort 12334
of 12335
knot, 12336
and 12337
then 12338
keep 12339
tight 12340
hold 12341
of 12342
its 12343
right 12344
ear 12345
and 12346
left 12347
foot, 12348
so 12349
as 12350
to 12351
prevent 12352
its 12353
undoing 12354
itself,) 12355
she 12356
carried 12357
it 12358
out 12359
into 12360
the 12361
open 12362
air. 12363
“If 12364
I 12365
don’t 12366
take 12367
this 12368
child 12369
away 12370
with 12371
me,” 12372
thought 12373
Alice, 12374
“they’re 12375
sure 12376
to 12377
kill 12378
it 12379
in 12380
a 12381
day 12382
or 12383
two: 12384
wouldn’t 12385
it 12386
be 12387
murder 12388
to 12389
leave 12390
it 12391
behind?” 12392
She 12393
said 12394
the 12395
last 12396
words 12397
out 12398
loud, 12399
and 12400
the 12401
little 12402
thing 12403
grunted 12404
in 12405
reply 12406
(it 12407
had 12408
left 12409
off 12410
sneezing 12411
by 12412
this 12413
time). 12414
“Don’t 12415
grunt,” 12416
said 12417
Alice; 12418
“that’s 12419
not 12420
at 12421
all 12422
a 12423
proper 12424
way 12425
of 12426
expressing 12427
yourself.” 12428
The 12429
baby 12430
grunted 12431
again, 12432
and 12433
Alice 12434
looked 12435
very 12436
anxiously 12437
into 12438
its 12439
face 12440
to 12441
see 12442
what 12443
was 12444
the 12445
matter 12446
with 12447
it. 12448
There 12449
could 12450
be 12451
no 12452
doubt 12453
that 12454
it 12455
had 12456
a 12457
_very_ 12458
turn-up 12459
nose, 12460
much 12461
more 12462
like 12463
a 12464
snout 12465
than 12466
a 12467
real 12468
nose; 12469
also 12470
its 12471
eyes 12472
were 12473
getting 12474
extremely 12475
small 12476
for 12477
a 12478
baby: 12479
altogether 12480
Alice 12481
did 12482
not 12483
like 12484
the 12485
look 12486
of 12487
the 12488
thing 12489
at 12490
all. 12491
“But 12492
perhaps 12493
it 12494
was 12495
only 12496
sobbing,” 12497
she 12498
thought, 12499
and 12500
looked 12501
into 12502
its 12503
eyes 12504
again, 12505
to 12506
see 12507
if 12508
there 12509
were 12510
any 12511
tears. 12512
No, 12513
there 12514
were 12515
no 12516
tears. 12517
“If 12518
you’re 12519
going 12520
to 12521
turn 12522
into 12523
a 12524
pig, 12525
my 12526
dear,” 12527
said 12528
Alice, 12529
seriously, 12530
“I’ll 12531
have 12532
nothing 12533
more 12534
to 12535
do 12536
with 12537
you. 12538
Mind 12539
now!” 12540
The 12541
poor 12542
little 12543
thing 12544
sobbed 12545
again 12546
(or 12547
grunted, 12548
it 12549
was 12550
impossible 12551
to 12552
say 12553
which), 12554
and 12555
they 12556
went 12557
on 12558
for 12559
some 12560
while 12561
in 12562
silence. 12563
Alice 12564
was 12565
just 12566
beginning 12567
to 12568
think 12569
to 12570
herself, 12571
“Now, 12572
what 12573
am 12574
I 12575
to 12576
do 12577
with 12578
this 12579
creature 12580
when 12581
I 12582
get 12583
it 12584
home?” 12585
when 12586
it 12587
grunted 12588
again, 12589
so 12590
violently, 12591
that 12592
she 12593
looked 12594
down 12595
into 12596
its 12597
face 12598
in 12599
some 12600
alarm. 12601
This 12602
time 12603
there 12604
could 12605
be 12606
_no_ 12607
mistake 12608
about 12609
it: 12610
it 12611
was 12612
neither 12613
more 12614
nor 12615
less 12616
than 12617
a 12618
pig, 12619
and 12620
she 12621
felt 12622
that 12623
it 12624
would 12625
be 12626
quite 12627
absurd 12628
for 12629
her 12630
to 12631
carry 12632
it 12633
further. 12634
So 12635
she 12636
set 12637
the 12638
little 12639
creature 12640
down, 12641
and 12642
felt 12643
quite 12644
relieved 12645
to 12646
see 12647
it 12648
trot 12649
away 12650
quietly 12651
into 12652
the 12653
wood. 12654
“If 12655
it 12656
had 12657
grown 12658
up,” 12659
she 12660
said 12661
to 12662
herself, 12663
“it 12664
would 12665
have 12666
made 12667
a 12668
dreadfully 12669
ugly 12670
child: 12671
but 12672
it 12673
makes 12674
rather 12675
a 12676
handsome 12677
pig, 12678
I 12679
think.” 12680
And 12681
she 12682
began 12683
thinking 12684
over 12685
other 12686
children 12687
she 12688
knew, 12689
who 12690
might 12691
do 12692
very 12693
well 12694
as 12695
pigs, 12696
and 12697
was 12698
just 12699
saying 12700
to 12701
herself, 12702
“if 12703
one 12704
only 12705
knew 12706
the 12707
right 12708
way 12709
to 12710
change 12711
them—” 12712
when 12713
she 12714
was 12715
a 12716
little 12717
startled 12718
by 12719
seeing 12720
the 12721
Cheshire 12722
Cat 12723
sitting 12724
on 12725
a 12726
bough 12727
of 12728
a 12729
tree 12730
a 12731
few 12732
yards 12733
off. 12734
The 12735
Cat 12736
only 12737
grinned 12738
when 12739
it 12740
saw 12741
Alice. 12742
It 12743
looked 12744
good-natured, 12745
she 12746
thought: 12747
still 12748
it 12749
had 12750
_very_ 12751
long 12752
claws 12753
and 12754
a 12755
great 12756
many 12757
teeth, 12758
so 12759
she 12760
felt 12761
that 12762
it 12763
ought 12764
to 12765
be 12766
treated 12767
with 12768
respect. 12769
“Cheshire 12770
Puss,” 12771
she 12772
began, 12773
rather 12774
timidly, 12775
as 12776
she 12777
did 12778
not 12779
at 12780
all 12781
know 12782
whether 12783
it 12784
would 12785
like 12786
the 12787
name: 12788
however, 12789
it 12790
only 12791
grinned 12792
a 12793
little 12794
wider. 12795
“Come, 12796
it’s 12797
pleased 12798
so 12799
far,” 12800
thought 12801
Alice, 12802
and 12803
she 12804
went 12805
on. 12806
“Would 12807
you 12808
tell 12809
me, 12810
please, 12811
which 12812
way 12813
I 12814
ought 12815
to 12816
go 12817
from 12818
here?” 12819
“That 12820
depends 12821
a 12822
good 12823
deal 12824
on 12825
where 12826
you 12827
want 12828
to 12829
get 12830
to,” 12831
said 12832
the 12833
Cat. 12834
“I 12835
don’t 12836
much 12837
care 12838
where—” 12839
said 12840
Alice. 12841
“Then 12842
it 12843
doesn’t 12844
matter 12845
which 12846
way 12847
you 12848
go,” 12849
said 12850
the 12851
Cat. 12852
“—so 12853
long 12854
as 12855
I 12856
get 12857
_somewhere_,” 12858
Alice 12859
added 12860
as 12861
an 12862
explanation. 12863
“Oh, 12864
you’re 12865
sure 12866
to 12867
do 12868
that,” 12869
said 12870
the 12871
Cat, 12872
“if 12873
you 12874
only 12875
walk 12876
long 12877
enough.” 12878
Alice 12879
felt 12880
that 12881
this 12882
could 12883
not 12884
be 12885
denied, 12886
so 12887
she 12888
tried 12889
another 12890
question. 12891
“What 12892
sort 12893
of 12894
people 12895
live 12896
about 12897
here?” 12898
“In 12899
_that_ 12900
direction,” 12901
the 12902
Cat 12903
said, 12904
waving 12905
its 12906
right 12907
paw 12908
round, 12909
“lives 12910
a 12911
Hatter: 12912
and 12913
in 12914
_that_ 12915
direction,” 12916
waving 12917
the 12918
other 12919
paw, 12920
“lives 12921
a 12922
March 12923
Hare. 12924
Visit 12925
either 12926
you 12927
like: 12928
they’re 12929
both 12930
mad.” 12931
“But 12932
I 12933
don’t 12934
want 12935
to 12936
go 12937
among 12938
mad 12939
people,” 12940
Alice 12941
remarked. 12942
“Oh, 12943
you 12944
can’t 12945
help 12946
that,” 12947
said 12948
the 12949
Cat: 12950
“we’re 12951
all 12952
mad 12953
here. 12954
I’m 12955
mad. 12956
You’re 12957
mad.” 12958
“How 12959
do 12960
you 12961
know 12962
I’m 12963
mad?” 12964
said 12965
Alice. 12966
“You 12967
must 12968
be,” 12969
said 12970
the 12971
Cat, 12972
“or 12973
you 12974
wouldn’t 12975
have 12976
come 12977
here.” 12978
Alice 12979
didn’t 12980
think 12981
that 12982
proved 12983
it 12984
at 12985
all; 12986
however, 12987
she 12988
went 12989
on 12990
“And 12991
how 12992
do 12993
you 12994
know 12995
that 12996
you’re 12997
mad?” 12998
“To 12999
begin 13000
with,” 13001
said 13002
the 13003
Cat, 13004
“a 13005
dog’s 13006
not 13007
mad. 13008
You 13009
grant 13010
that?” 13011
“I 13012
suppose 13013
so,” 13014
said 13015
Alice. 13016
“Well, 13017
then,” 13018
the 13019
Cat 13020
went 13021
on, 13022
“you 13023
see, 13024
a 13025
dog 13026
growls 13027
when 13028
it’s 13029
angry, 13030
and 13031
wags 13032
its 13033
tail 13034
when 13035
it’s 13036
pleased. 13037
Now 13038
_I_ 13039
growl 13040
when 13041
I’m 13042
pleased, 13043
and 13044
wag 13045
my 13046
tail 13047
when 13048
I’m 13049
angry. 13050
Therefore 13051
I’m 13052
mad.” 13053
“_I_ 13054
call 13055
it 13056
purring, 13057
not 13058
growling,” 13059
said 13060
Alice. 13061
“Call 13062
it 13063
what 13064
you 13065
like,” 13066
said 13067
the 13068
Cat. 13069
“Do 13070
you 13071
play 13072
croquet 13073
with 13074
the 13075
Queen 13076
to-day?” 13077
“I 13078
should 13079
like 13080
it 13081
very 13082
much,” 13083
said 13084
Alice, 13085
“but 13086
I 13087
haven’t 13088
been 13089
invited 13090
yet.” 13091
“You’ll 13092
see 13093
me 13094
there,” 13095
said 13096
the 13097
Cat, 13098
and 13099
vanished. 13100
Alice 13101
was 13102
not 13103
much 13104
surprised 13105
at 13106
this, 13107
she 13108
was 13109
getting 13110
so 13111
used 13112
to 13113
queer 13114
things 13115
happening. 13116
While 13117
she 13118
was 13119
looking 13120
at 13121
the 13122
place 13123
where 13124
it 13125
had 13126
been, 13127
it 13128
suddenly 13129
appeared 13130
again. 13131
“By-the-bye, 13132
what 13133
became 13134
of 13135
the 13136
baby?” 13137
said 13138
the 13139
Cat. 13140
“I’d 13141
nearly 13142
forgotten 13143
to 13144
ask.” 13145
“It 13146
turned 13147
into 13148
a 13149
pig,” 13150
Alice 13151
quietly 13152
said, 13153
just 13154
as 13155
if 13156
it 13157
had 13158
come 13159
back 13160
in 13161
a 13162
natural 13163
way. 13164
“I 13165
thought 13166
it 13167
would,” 13168
said 13169
the 13170
Cat, 13171
and 13172
vanished 13173
again. 13174
Alice 13175
waited 13176
a 13177
little, 13178
half 13179
expecting 13180
to 13181
see 13182
it 13183
again, 13184
but 13185
it 13186
did 13187
not 13188
appear, 13189
and 13190
after 13191
a 13192
minute 13193
or 13194
two 13195
she 13196
walked 13197
on 13198
in 13199
the 13200
direction 13201
in 13202
which 13203
the 13204
March 13205
Hare 13206
was 13207
said 13208
to 13209
live. 13210
“I’ve 13211
seen 13212
hatters 13213
before,” 13214
she 13215
said 13216
to 13217
herself; 13218
“the 13219
March 13220
Hare 13221
will 13222
be 13223
much 13224
the 13225
most 13226
interesting, 13227
and 13228
perhaps 13229
as 13230
this 13231
is 13232
May 13233
it 13234
won’t 13235
be 13236
raving 13237
mad—at 13238
least 13239
not 13240
so 13241
mad 13242
as 13243
it 13244
was 13245
in 13246
March.” 13247
As 13248
she 13249
said 13250
this, 13251
she 13252
looked 13253
up, 13254
and 13255
there 13256
was 13257
the 13258
Cat 13259
again, 13260
sitting 13261
on 13262
a 13263
branch 13264
of 13265
a 13266
tree. 13267
“Did 13268
you 13269
say 13270
pig, 13271
or 13272
fig?” 13273
said 13274
the 13275
Cat. 13276
“I 13277
said 13278
pig,” 13279
replied 13280
Alice; 13281
“and 13282
I 13283
wish 13284
you 13285
wouldn’t 13286
keep 13287
appearing 13288
and 13289
vanishing 13290
so 13291
suddenly: 13292
you 13293
make 13294
one 13295
quite 13296
giddy.” 13297
“All 13298
right,” 13299
said 13300
the 13301
Cat; 13302
and 13303
this 13304
time 13305
it 13306
vanished 13307
quite 13308
slowly, 13309
beginning 13310
with 13311
the 13312
end 13313
of 13314
the 13315
tail, 13316
and 13317
ending 13318
with 13319
the 13320
grin, 13321
which 13322
remained 13323
some 13324
time 13325
after 13326
the 13327
rest 13328
of 13329
it 13330
had 13331
gone. 13332
“Well! 13333
I’ve 13334
often 13335
seen 13336
a 13337
cat 13338
without 13339
a 13340
grin,” 13341
thought 13342
Alice; 13343
“but 13344
a 13345
grin 13346
without 13347
a 13348
cat! 13349
It’s 13350
the 13351
most 13352
curious 13353
thing 13354
I 13355
ever 13356
saw 13357
in 13358
my 13359
life!” 13360
She 13361
had 13362
not 13363
gone 13364
much 13365
farther 13366
before 13367
she 13368
came 13369
in 13370
sight 13371
of 13372
the 13373
house 13374
of 13375
the 13376
March 13377
Hare: 13378
she 13379
thought 13380
it 13381
must 13382
be 13383
the 13384
right 13385
house, 13386
because 13387
the 13388
chimneys 13389
were 13390
shaped 13391
like 13392
ears 13393
and 13394
the 13395
roof 13396
was 13397
thatched 13398
with 13399
fur. 13400
It 13401
was 13402
so 13403
large 13404
a 13405
house, 13406
that 13407
she 13408
did 13409
not 13410
like 13411
to 13412
go 13413
nearer 13414
till 13415
she 13416
had 13417
nibbled 13418
some 13419
more 13420
of 13421
the 13422
lefthand 13423
bit 13424
of 13425
mushroom, 13426
and 13427
raised 13428
herself 13429
to 13430
about 13431
two 13432
feet 13433
high: 13434
even 13435
then 13436
she 13437
walked 13438
up 13439
towards 13440
it 13441
rather 13442
timidly, 13443
saying 13444
to 13445
herself 13446
“Suppose 13447
it 13448
should 13449
be 13450
raving 13451
mad 13452
after 13453
all! 13454
I 13455
almost 13456
wish 13457
I’d 13458
gone 13459
to 13460
see 13461
the 13462
Hatter 13463
instead!” 13464
CHAPTER 13465
VII. 13466
A 13467
Mad 13468
Tea-Party 13469
There 13470
was 13471
a 13472
table 13473
set 13474
out 13475
under 13476
a 13477
tree 13478
in 13479
front 13480
of 13481
the 13482
house, 13483
and 13484
the 13485
March 13486
Hare 13487
and 13488
the 13489
Hatter 13490
were 13491
having 13492
tea 13493
at 13494
it: 13495
a 13496
Dormouse 13497
was 13498
sitting 13499
between 13500
them, 13501
fast 13502
asleep, 13503
and 13504
the 13505
other 13506
two 13507
were 13508
using 13509
it 13510
as 13511
a 13512
cushion, 13513
resting 13514
their 13515
elbows 13516
on 13517
it, 13518
and 13519
talking 13520
over 13521
its 13522
head. 13523
“Very 13524
uncomfortable 13525
for 13526
the 13527
Dormouse,” 13528
thought 13529
Alice; 13530
“only, 13531
as 13532
it’s 13533
asleep, 13534
I 13535
suppose 13536
it 13537
doesn’t 13538
mind.” 13539
The 13540
table 13541
was 13542
a 13543
large 13544
one, 13545
but 13546
the 13547
three 13548
were 13549
all 13550
crowded 13551
together 13552
at 13553
one 13554
corner 13555
of 13556
it: 13557
“No 13558
room! 13559
No 13560
room!” 13561
they 13562
cried 13563
out 13564
when 13565
they 13566
saw 13567
Alice 13568
coming. 13569
“There’s 13570
_plenty_ 13571
of 13572
room!” 13573
said 13574
Alice 13575
indignantly, 13576
and 13577
she 13578
sat 13579
down 13580
in 13581
a 13582
large 13583
arm-chair 13584
at 13585
one 13586
end 13587
of 13588
the 13589
table. 13590
“Have 13591
some 13592
wine,” 13593
the 13594
March 13595
Hare 13596
said 13597
in 13598
an 13599
encouraging 13600
tone. 13601
Alice 13602
looked 13603
all 13604
round 13605
the 13606
table, 13607
but 13608
there 13609
was 13610
nothing 13611
on 13612
it 13613
but 13614
tea. 13615
“I 13616
don’t 13617
see 13618
any 13619
wine,” 13620
she 13621
remarked. 13622
“There 13623
isn’t 13624
any,” 13625
said 13626
the 13627
March 13628
Hare. 13629
“Then 13630
it 13631
wasn’t 13632
very 13633
civil 13634
of 13635
you 13636
to 13637
offer 13638
it,” 13639
said 13640
Alice 13641
angrily. 13642
“It 13643
wasn’t 13644
very 13645
civil 13646
of 13647
you 13648
to 13649
sit 13650
down 13651
without 13652
being 13653
invited,” 13654
said 13655
the 13656
March 13657
Hare. 13658
“I 13659
didn’t 13660
know 13661
it 13662
was 13663
_your_ 13664
table,” 13665
said 13666
Alice; 13667
“it’s 13668
laid 13669
for 13670
a 13671
great 13672
many 13673
more 13674
than 13675
three.” 13676
“Your 13677
hair 13678
wants 13679
cutting,” 13680
said 13681
the 13682
Hatter. 13683
He 13684
had 13685
been 13686
looking 13687
at 13688
Alice 13689
for 13690
some 13691
time 13692
with 13693
great 13694
curiosity, 13695
and 13696
this 13697
was 13698
his 13699
first 13700
speech. 13701
“You 13702
should 13703
learn 13704
not 13705
to 13706
make 13707
personal 13708
remarks,” 13709
Alice 13710
said 13711
with 13712
some 13713
severity; 13714
“it’s 13715
very 13716
rude.” 13717
The 13718
Hatter 13719
opened 13720
his 13721
eyes 13722
very 13723
wide 13724
on 13725
hearing 13726
this; 13727
but 13728
all 13729
he 13730
_said_ 13731
was, 13732
“Why 13733
is 13734
a 13735
raven 13736
like 13737
a 13738
writing-desk?” 13739
“Come, 13740
we 13741
shall 13742
have 13743
some 13744
fun 13745
now!” 13746
thought 13747
Alice. 13748
“I’m 13749
glad 13750
they’ve 13751
begun 13752
asking 13753
riddles.—I 13754
believe 13755
I 13756
can 13757
guess 13758
that,” 13759
she 13760
added 13761
aloud. 13762
“Do 13763
you 13764
mean 13765
that 13766
you 13767
think 13768
you 13769
can 13770
find 13771
out 13772
the 13773
answer 13774
to 13775
it?” 13776
said 13777
the 13778
March 13779
Hare. 13780
“Exactly 13781
so,” 13782
said 13783
Alice. 13784
“Then 13785
you 13786
should 13787
say 13788
what 13789
you 13790
mean,” 13791
the 13792
March 13793
Hare 13794
went 13795
on. 13796
“I 13797
do,” 13798
Alice 13799
hastily 13800
replied; 13801
“at 13802
least—at 13803
least 13804
I 13805
mean 13806
what 13807
I 13808
say—that’s 13809
the 13810
same 13811
thing, 13812
you 13813
know.” 13814
“Not 13815
the 13816
same 13817
thing 13818
a 13819
bit!” 13820
said 13821
the 13822
Hatter. 13823
“You 13824
might 13825
just 13826
as 13827
well 13828
say 13829
that 13830
‘I 13831
see 13832
what 13833
I 13834
eat’ 13835
is 13836
the 13837
same 13838
thing 13839
as 13840
‘I 13841
eat 13842
what 13843
I 13844
see’!” 13845
“You 13846
might 13847
just 13848
as 13849
well 13850
say,” 13851
added 13852
the 13853
March 13854
Hare, 13855
“that 13856
‘I 13857
like 13858
what 13859
I 13860
get’ 13861
is 13862
the 13863
same 13864
thing 13865
as 13866
‘I 13867
get 13868
what 13869
I 13870
like’!” 13871
“You 13872
might 13873
just 13874
as 13875
well 13876
say,” 13877
added 13878
the 13879
Dormouse, 13880
who 13881
seemed 13882
to 13883
be 13884
talking 13885
in 13886
his 13887
sleep, 13888
“that 13889
‘I 13890
breathe 13891
when 13892
I 13893
sleep’ 13894
is 13895
the 13896
same 13897
thing 13898
as 13899
‘I 13900
sleep 13901
when 13902
I 13903
breathe’!” 13904
“It 13905
_is_ 13906
the 13907
same 13908
thing 13909
with 13910
you,” 13911
said 13912
the 13913
Hatter, 13914
and 13915
here 13916
the 13917
conversation 13918
dropped, 13919
and 13920
the 13921
party 13922
sat 13923
silent 13924
for 13925
a 13926
minute, 13927
while 13928
Alice 13929
thought 13930
over 13931
all 13932
she 13933
could 13934
remember 13935
about 13936
ravens 13937
and 13938
writing-desks, 13939
which 13940
wasn’t 13941
much. 13942
The 13943
Hatter 13944
was 13945
the 13946
first 13947
to 13948
break 13949
the 13950
silence. 13951
“What 13952
day 13953
of 13954
the 13955
month 13956
is 13957
it?” 13958
he 13959
said, 13960
turning 13961
to 13962
Alice: 13963
he 13964
had 13965
taken 13966
his 13967
watch 13968
out 13969
of 13970
his 13971
pocket, 13972
and 13973
was 13974
looking 13975
at 13976
it 13977
uneasily, 13978
shaking 13979
it 13980
every 13981
now 13982
and 13983
then, 13984
and 13985
holding 13986
it 13987
to 13988
his 13989
ear. 13990
Alice 13991
considered 13992
a 13993
little, 13994
and 13995
then 13996
said 13997
“The 13998
fourth.” 13999
“Two 14000
days 14001
wrong!” 14002
sighed 14003
the 14004
Hatter. 14005
“I 14006
told 14007
you 14008
butter 14009
wouldn’t 14010
suit 14011
the 14012
works!” 14013
he 14014
added 14015
looking 14016
angrily 14017
at 14018
the 14019
March 14020
Hare. 14021
“It 14022
was 14023
the 14024
_best_ 14025
butter,” 14026
the 14027
March 14028
Hare 14029
meekly 14030
replied. 14031
“Yes, 14032
but 14033
some 14034
crumbs 14035
must 14036
have 14037
got 14038
in 14039
as 14040
well,” 14041
the 14042
Hatter 14043
grumbled: 14044
“you 14045
shouldn’t 14046
have 14047
put 14048
it 14049
in 14050
with 14051
the 14052
bread-knife.” 14053
The 14054
March 14055
Hare 14056
took 14057
the 14058
watch 14059
and 14060
looked 14061
at 14062
it 14063
gloomily: 14064
then 14065
he 14066
dipped 14067
it 14068
into 14069
his 14070
cup 14071
of 14072
tea, 14073
and 14074
looked 14075
at 14076
it 14077
again: 14078
but 14079
he 14080
could 14081
think 14082
of 14083
nothing 14084
better 14085
to 14086
say 14087
than 14088
his 14089
first 14090
remark, 14091
“It 14092
was 14093
the 14094
_best_ 14095
butter, 14096
you 14097
know.” 14098
Alice 14099
had 14100
been 14101
looking 14102
over 14103
his 14104
shoulder 14105
with 14106
some 14107
curiosity. 14108
“What 14109
a 14110
funny 14111
watch!” 14112
she 14113
remarked. 14114
“It 14115
tells 14116
the 14117
day 14118
of 14119
the 14120
month, 14121
and 14122
doesn’t 14123
tell 14124
what 14125
o’clock 14126
it 14127
is!” 14128
“Why 14129
should 14130
it?” 14131
muttered 14132
the 14133
Hatter. 14134
“Does 14135
_your_ 14136
watch 14137
tell 14138
you 14139
what 14140
year 14141
it 14142
is?” 14143
“Of 14144
course 14145
not,” 14146
Alice 14147
replied 14148
very 14149
readily: 14150
“but 14151
that’s 14152
because 14153
it 14154
stays 14155
the 14156
same 14157
year 14158
for 14159
such 14160
a 14161
long 14162
time 14163
together.” 14164
“Which 14165
is 14166
just 14167
the 14168
case 14169
with 14170
_mine_,” 14171
said 14172
the 14173
Hatter. 14174
Alice 14175
felt 14176
dreadfully 14177
puzzled. 14178
The 14179
Hatter’s 14180
remark 14181
seemed 14182
to 14183
have 14184
no 14185
sort 14186
of 14187
meaning 14188
in 14189
it, 14190
and 14191
yet 14192
it 14193
was 14194
certainly 14195
English. 14196
“I 14197
don’t 14198
quite 14199
understand 14200
you,” 14201
she 14202
said, 14203
as 14204
politely 14205
as 14206
she 14207
could. 14208
“The 14209
Dormouse 14210
is 14211
asleep 14212
again,” 14213
said 14214
the 14215
Hatter, 14216
and 14217
he 14218
poured 14219
a 14220
little 14221
hot 14222
tea 14223
upon 14224
its 14225
nose. 14226
The 14227
Dormouse 14228
shook 14229
its 14230
head 14231
impatiently, 14232
and 14233
said, 14234
without 14235
opening 14236
its 14237
eyes, 14238
“Of 14239
course, 14240
of 14241
course; 14242
just 14243
what 14244
I 14245
was 14246
going 14247
to 14248
remark 14249
myself.” 14250
“Have 14251
you 14252
guessed 14253
the 14254
riddle 14255
yet?” 14256
the 14257
Hatter 14258
said, 14259
turning 14260
to 14261
Alice 14262
again. 14263
“No, 14264
I 14265
give 14266
it 14267
up,” 14268
Alice 14269
replied: 14270
“what’s 14271
the 14272
answer?” 14273
“I 14274
haven’t 14275
the 14276
slightest 14277
idea,” 14278
said 14279
the 14280
Hatter. 14281
“Nor 14282
I,” 14283
said 14284
the 14285
March 14286
Hare. 14287
Alice 14288
sighed 14289
wearily. 14290
“I 14291
think 14292
you 14293
might 14294
do 14295
something 14296
better 14297
with 14298
the 14299
time,” 14300
she 14301
said, 14302
“than 14303
waste 14304
it 14305
in 14306
asking 14307
riddles 14308
that 14309
have 14310
no 14311
answers.” 14312
“If 14313
you 14314
knew 14315
Time 14316
as 14317
well 14318
as 14319
I 14320
do,” 14321
said 14322
the 14323
Hatter, 14324
“you 14325
wouldn’t 14326
talk 14327
about 14328
wasting 14329
_it_. 14330
It’s 14331
_him_.” 14332
“I 14333
don’t 14334
know 14335
what 14336
you 14337
mean,” 14338
said 14339
Alice. 14340
“Of 14341
course 14342
you 14343
don’t!” 14344
the 14345
Hatter 14346
said, 14347
tossing 14348
his 14349
head 14350
contemptuously. 14351
“I 14352
dare 14353
say 14354
you 14355
never 14356
even 14357
spoke 14358
to 14359
Time!” 14360
“Perhaps 14361
not,” 14362
Alice 14363
cautiously 14364
replied: 14365
“but 14366
I 14367
know 14368
I 14369
have 14370
to 14371
beat 14372
time 14373
when 14374
I 14375
learn 14376
music.” 14377
“Ah! 14378
that 14379
accounts 14380
for 14381
it,” 14382
said 14383
the 14384
Hatter. 14385
“He 14386
won’t 14387
stand 14388
beating. 14389
Now, 14390
if 14391
you 14392
only 14393
kept 14394
on 14395
good 14396
terms 14397
with 14398
him, 14399
he’d 14400
do 14401
almost 14402
anything 14403
you 14404
liked 14405
with 14406
the 14407
clock. 14408
For 14409
instance, 14410
suppose 14411
it 14412
were 14413
nine 14414
o’clock 14415
in 14416
the 14417
morning, 14418
just 14419
time 14420
to 14421
begin 14422
lessons: 14423
you’d 14424
only 14425
have 14426
to 14427
whisper 14428
a 14429
hint 14430
to 14431
Time, 14432
and 14433
round 14434
goes 14435
the 14436
clock 14437
in 14438
a 14439
twinkling! 14440
Half-past 14441
one, 14442
time 14443
for 14444
dinner!” 14445
(“I 14446
only 14447
wish 14448
it 14449
was,” 14450
the 14451
March 14452
Hare 14453
said 14454
to 14455
itself 14456
in 14457
a 14458
whisper.) 14459
“That 14460
would 14461
be 14462
grand, 14463
certainly,” 14464
said 14465
Alice 14466
thoughtfully: 14467
“but 14468
then—I 14469
shouldn’t 14470
be 14471
hungry 14472
for 14473
it, 14474
you 14475
know.” 14476
“Not 14477
at 14478
first, 14479
perhaps,” 14480
said 14481
the 14482
Hatter: 14483
“but 14484
you 14485
could 14486
keep 14487
it 14488
to 14489
half-past 14490
one 14491
as 14492
long 14493
as 14494
you 14495
liked.” 14496
“Is 14497
that 14498
the 14499
way 14500
_you_ 14501
manage?” 14502
Alice 14503
asked. 14504
The 14505
Hatter 14506
shook 14507
his 14508
head 14509
mournfully. 14510
“Not 14511
I!” 14512
he 14513
replied. 14514
“We 14515
quarrelled 14516
last 14517
March—just 14518
before 14519
_he_ 14520
went 14521
mad, 14522
you 14523
know—” 14524
(pointing 14525
with 14526
his 14527
tea 14528
spoon 14529
at 14530
the 14531
March 14532
Hare,) 14533
“—it 14534
was 14535
at 14536
the 14537
great 14538
concert 14539
given 14540
by 14541
the 14542
Queen 14543
of 14544
Hearts, 14545
and 14546
I 14547
had 14548
to 14549
sing 14550
‘Twinkle, 14551
twinkle, 14552
little 14553
bat! 14554
How 14555
I 14556
wonder 14557
what 14558
you’re 14559
at!’ 14560
You 14561
know 14562
the 14563
song, 14564
perhaps?” 14565
“I’ve 14566
heard 14567
something 14568
like 14569
it,” 14570
said 14571
Alice. 14572
“It 14573
goes 14574
on, 14575
you 14576
know,” 14577
the 14578
Hatter 14579
continued, 14580
“in 14581
this 14582
way:— 14583
‘Up 14584
above 14585
the 14586
world 14587
you 14588
fly, 14589
Like 14590
a 14591
tea-tray 14592
in 14593
the 14594
sky. 14595
Twinkle, 14596
twinkle—’” 14597
Here 14598
the 14599
Dormouse 14600
shook 14601
itself, 14602
and 14603
began 14604
singing 14605
in 14606
its 14607
sleep 14608
“_Twinkle, 14609
twinkle, 14610
twinkle, 14611
twinkle_—” 14612
and 14613
went 14614
on 14615
so 14616
long 14617
that 14618
they 14619
had 14620
to 14621
pinch 14622
it 14623
to 14624
make 14625
it 14626
stop. 14627
“Well, 14628
I’d 14629
hardly 14630
finished 14631
the 14632
first 14633
verse,” 14634
said 14635
the 14636
Hatter, 14637
“when 14638
the 14639
Queen 14640
jumped 14641
up 14642
and 14643
bawled 14644
out, 14645
‘He’s 14646
murdering 14647
the 14648
time! 14649
Off 14650
with 14651
his 14652
head!’” 14653
“How 14654
dreadfully 14655
savage!” 14656
exclaimed 14657
Alice. 14658
“And 14659
ever 14660
since 14661
that,” 14662
the 14663
Hatter 14664
went 14665
on 14666
in 14667
a 14668
mournful 14669
tone, 14670
“he 14671
won’t 14672
do 14673
a 14674
thing 14675
I 14676
ask! 14677
It’s 14678
always 14679
six 14680
o’clock 14681
now.” 14682
A 14683
bright 14684
idea 14685
came 14686
into 14687
Alice’s 14688
head. 14689
“Is 14690
that 14691
the 14692
reason 14693
so 14694
many 14695
tea-things 14696
are 14697
put 14698
out 14699
here?” 14700
she 14701
asked. 14702
“Yes, 14703
that’s 14704
it,” 14705
said 14706
the 14707
Hatter 14708
with 14709
a 14710
sigh: 14711
“it’s 14712
always 14713
tea-time, 14714
and 14715
we’ve 14716
no 14717
time 14718
to 14719
wash 14720
the 14721
things 14722
between 14723
whiles.” 14724
“Then 14725
you 14726
keep 14727
moving 14728
round, 14729
I 14730
suppose?” 14731
said 14732
Alice. 14733
“Exactly 14734
so,” 14735
said 14736
the 14737
Hatter: 14738
“as 14739
the 14740
things 14741
get 14742
used 14743
up.” 14744
“But 14745
what 14746
happens 14747
when 14748
you 14749
come 14750
to 14751
the 14752
beginning 14753
again?” 14754
Alice 14755
ventured 14756
to 14757
ask. 14758
“Suppose 14759
we 14760
change 14761
the 14762
subject,” 14763
the 14764
March 14765
Hare 14766
interrupted, 14767
yawning. 14768
“I’m 14769
getting 14770
tired 14771
of 14772
this. 14773
I 14774
vote 14775
the 14776
young 14777
lady 14778
tells 14779
us 14780
a 14781
story.” 14782
“I’m 14783
afraid 14784
I 14785
don’t 14786
know 14787
one,” 14788
said 14789
Alice, 14790
rather 14791
alarmed 14792
at 14793
the 14794
proposal. 14795
“Then 14796
the 14797
Dormouse 14798
shall!” 14799
they 14800
both 14801
cried. 14802
“Wake 14803
up, 14804
Dormouse!” 14805
And 14806
they 14807
pinched 14808
it 14809
on 14810
both 14811
sides 14812
at 14813
once. 14814
The 14815
Dormouse 14816
slowly 14817
opened 14818
his 14819
eyes. 14820
“I 14821
wasn’t 14822
asleep,” 14823
he 14824
said 14825
in 14826
a 14827
hoarse, 14828
feeble 14829
voice: 14830
“I 14831
heard 14832
every 14833
word 14834
you 14835
fellows 14836
were 14837
saying.” 14838
“Tell 14839
us 14840
a 14841
story!” 14842
said 14843
the 14844
March 14845
Hare. 14846
“Yes, 14847
please 14848
do!” 14849
pleaded 14850
Alice. 14851
“And 14852
be 14853
quick 14854
about 14855
it,” 14856
added 14857
the 14858
Hatter, 14859
“or 14860
you’ll 14861
be 14862
asleep 14863
again 14864
before 14865
it’s 14866
done.” 14867
“Once 14868
upon 14869
a 14870
time 14871
there 14872
were 14873
three 14874
little 14875
sisters,” 14876
the 14877
Dormouse 14878
began 14879
in 14880
a 14881
great 14882
hurry; 14883
“and 14884
their 14885
names 14886
were 14887
Elsie, 14888
Lacie, 14889
and 14890
Tillie; 14891
and 14892
they 14893
lived 14894
at 14895
the 14896
bottom 14897
of 14898
a 14899
well—” 14900
“What 14901
did 14902
they 14903
live 14904
on?” 14905
said 14906
Alice, 14907
who 14908
always 14909
took 14910
a 14911
great 14912
interest 14913
in 14914
questions 14915
of 14916
eating 14917
and 14918
drinking. 14919
“They 14920
lived 14921
on 14922
treacle,” 14923
said 14924
the 14925
Dormouse, 14926
after 14927
thinking 14928
a 14929
minute 14930
or 14931
two. 14932
“They 14933
couldn’t 14934
have 14935
done 14936
that, 14937
you 14938
know,” 14939
Alice 14940
gently 14941
remarked; 14942
“they’d 14943
have 14944
been 14945
ill.” 14946
“So 14947
they 14948
were,” 14949
said 14950
the 14951
Dormouse; 14952
“_very_ 14953
ill.” 14954
Alice 14955
tried 14956
to 14957
fancy 14958
to 14959
herself 14960
what 14961
such 14962
an 14963
extraordinary 14964
way 14965
of 14966
living 14967
would 14968
be 14969
like, 14970
but 14971
it 14972
puzzled 14973
her 14974
too 14975
much, 14976
so 14977
she 14978
went 14979
on: 14980
“But 14981
why 14982
did 14983
they 14984
live 14985
at 14986
the 14987
bottom 14988
of 14989
a 14990
well?” 14991
“Take 14992
some 14993
more 14994
tea,” 14995
the 14996
March 14997
Hare 14998
said 14999
to 15000
Alice, 15001
very 15002
earnestly. 15003
“I’ve 15004
had 15005
nothing 15006
yet,” 15007
Alice 15008
replied 15009
in 15010
an 15011
offended 15012
tone, 15013
“so 15014
I 15015
can’t 15016
take 15017
more.” 15018
“You 15019
mean 15020
you 15021
can’t 15022
take 15023
_less_,” 15024
said 15025
the 15026
Hatter: 15027
“it’s 15028
very 15029
easy 15030
to 15031
take 15032
_more_ 15033
than 15034
nothing.” 15035
“Nobody 15036
asked 15037
_your_ 15038
opinion,” 15039
said 15040
Alice. 15041
“Who’s 15042
making 15043
personal 15044
remarks 15045
now?” 15046
the 15047
Hatter 15048
asked 15049
triumphantly. 15050
Alice 15051
did 15052
not 15053
quite 15054
know 15055
what 15056
to 15057
say 15058
to 15059
this: 15060
so 15061
she 15062
helped 15063
herself 15064
to 15065
some 15066
tea 15067
and 15068
bread-and-butter, 15069
and 15070
then 15071
turned 15072
to 15073
the 15074
Dormouse, 15075
and 15076
repeated 15077
her 15078
question. 15079
“Why 15080
did 15081
they 15082
live 15083
at 15084
the 15085
bottom 15086
of 15087
a 15088
well?” 15089
The 15090
Dormouse 15091
again 15092
took 15093
a 15094
minute 15095
or 15096
two 15097
to 15098
think 15099
about 15100
it, 15101
and 15102
then 15103
said, 15104
“It 15105
was 15106
a 15107
treacle-well.” 15108
“There’s 15109
no 15110
such 15111
thing!” 15112
Alice 15113
was 15114
beginning 15115
very 15116
angrily, 15117
but 15118
the 15119
Hatter 15120
and 15121
the 15122
March 15123
Hare 15124
went 15125
“Sh! 15126
sh!” 15127
and 15128
the 15129
Dormouse 15130
sulkily 15131
remarked, 15132
“If 15133
you 15134
can’t 15135
be 15136
civil, 15137
you’d 15138
better 15139
finish 15140
the 15141
story 15142
for 15143
yourself.” 15144
“No, 15145
please 15146
go 15147
on!” 15148
Alice 15149
said 15150
very 15151
humbly; 15152
“I 15153
won’t 15154
interrupt 15155
again. 15156
I 15157
dare 15158
say 15159
there 15160
may 15161
be 15162
_one_.” 15163
“One, 15164
indeed!” 15165
said 15166
the 15167
Dormouse 15168
indignantly. 15169
However, 15170
he 15171
consented 15172
to 15173
go 15174
on. 15175
“And 15176
so 15177
these 15178
three 15179
little 15180
sisters—they 15181
were 15182
learning 15183
to 15184
draw, 15185
you 15186
know—” 15187
“What 15188
did 15189
they 15190
draw?” 15191
said 15192
Alice, 15193
quite 15194
forgetting 15195
her 15196
promise. 15197
“Treacle,” 15198
said 15199
the 15200
Dormouse, 15201
without 15202
considering 15203
at 15204
all 15205
this 15206
time. 15207
“I 15208
want 15209
a 15210
clean 15211
cup,” 15212
interrupted 15213
the 15214
Hatter: 15215
“let’s 15216
all 15217
move 15218
one 15219
place 15220
on.” 15221
He 15222
moved 15223
on 15224
as 15225
he 15226
spoke, 15227
and 15228
the 15229
Dormouse 15230
followed 15231
him: 15232
the 15233
March 15234
Hare 15235
moved 15236
into 15237
the 15238
Dormouse’s 15239
place, 15240
and 15241
Alice 15242
rather 15243
unwillingly 15244
took 15245
the 15246
place 15247
of 15248
the 15249
March 15250
Hare. 15251
The 15252
Hatter 15253
was 15254
the 15255
only 15256
one 15257
who 15258
got 15259
any 15260
advantage 15261
from 15262
the 15263
change: 15264
and 15265
Alice 15266
was 15267
a 15268
good 15269
deal 15270
worse 15271
off 15272
than 15273
before, 15274
as 15275
the 15276
March 15277
Hare 15278
had 15279
just 15280
upset 15281
the 15282
milk-jug 15283
into 15284
his 15285
plate. 15286
Alice 15287
did 15288
not 15289
wish 15290
to 15291
offend 15292
the 15293
Dormouse 15294
again, 15295
so 15296
she 15297
began 15298
very 15299
cautiously: 15300
“But 15301
I 15302
don’t 15303
understand. 15304
Where 15305
did 15306
they 15307
draw 15308
the 15309
treacle 15310
from?” 15311
“You 15312
can 15313
draw 15314
water 15315
out 15316
of 15317
a 15318
water-well,” 15319
said 15320
the 15321
Hatter; 15322
“so 15323
I 15324
should 15325
think 15326
you 15327
could 15328
draw 15329
treacle 15330
out 15331
of 15332
a 15333
treacle-well—eh, 15334
stupid?” 15335
“But 15336
they 15337
were 15338
_in_ 15339
the 15340
well,” 15341
Alice 15342
said 15343
to 15344
the 15345
Dormouse, 15346
not 15347
choosing 15348
to 15349
notice 15350
this 15351
last 15352
remark. 15353
“Of 15354
course 15355
they 15356
were,” 15357
said 15358
the 15359
Dormouse; 15360
“—well 15361
in.” 15362
This 15363
answer 15364
so 15365
confused 15366
poor 15367
Alice, 15368
that 15369
she 15370
let 15371
the 15372
Dormouse 15373
go 15374
on 15375
for 15376
some 15377
time 15378
without 15379
interrupting 15380
it. 15381
“They 15382
were 15383
learning 15384
to 15385
draw,” 15386
the 15387
Dormouse 15388
went 15389
on, 15390
yawning 15391
and 15392
rubbing 15393
its 15394
eyes, 15395
for 15396
it 15397
was 15398
getting 15399
very 15400
sleepy; 15401
“and 15402
they 15403
drew 15404
all 15405
manner 15406
of 15407
things—everything 15408
that 15409
begins 15410
with 15411
an 15412
M—” 15413
“Why 15414
with 15415
an 15416
M?” 15417
said 15418
Alice. 15419
“Why 15420
not?” 15421
said 15422
the 15423
March 15424
Hare. 15425
Alice 15426
was 15427
silent. 15428
The 15429
Dormouse 15430
had 15431
closed 15432
its 15433
eyes 15434
by 15435
this 15436
time, 15437
and 15438
was 15439
going 15440
off 15441
into 15442
a 15443
doze; 15444
but, 15445
on 15446
being 15447
pinched 15448
by 15449
the 15450
Hatter, 15451
it 15452
woke 15453
up 15454
again 15455
with 15456
a 15457
little 15458
shriek, 15459
and 15460
went 15461
on: 15462
“—that 15463
begins 15464
with 15465
an 15466
M, 15467
such 15468
as 15469
mouse-traps, 15470
and 15471
the 15472
moon, 15473
and 15474
memory, 15475
and 15476
muchness—you 15477
know 15478
you 15479
say 15480
things 15481
are 15482
“much 15483
of 15484
a 15485
muchness”—did 15486
you 15487
ever 15488
see 15489
such 15490
a 15491
thing 15492
as 15493
a 15494
drawing 15495
of 15496
a 15497
muchness?” 15498
“Really, 15499
now 15500
you 15501
ask 15502
me,” 15503
said 15504
Alice, 15505
very 15506
much 15507
confused, 15508
“I 15509
don’t 15510
think—” 15511
“Then 15512
you 15513
shouldn’t 15514
talk,” 15515
said 15516
the 15517
Hatter. 15518
This 15519
piece 15520
of 15521
rudeness 15522
was 15523
more 15524
than 15525
Alice 15526
could 15527
bear: 15528
she 15529
got 15530
up 15531
in 15532
great 15533
disgust, 15534
and 15535
walked 15536
off; 15537
the 15538
Dormouse 15539
fell 15540
asleep 15541
instantly, 15542
and 15543
neither 15544
of 15545
the 15546
others 15547
took 15548
the 15549
least 15550
notice 15551
of 15552
her 15553
going, 15554
though 15555
she 15556
looked 15557
back 15558
once 15559
or 15560
twice, 15561
half 15562
hoping 15563
that 15564
they 15565
would 15566
call 15567
after 15568
her: 15569
the 15570
last 15571
time 15572
she 15573
saw 15574
them, 15575
they 15576
were 15577
trying 15578
to 15579
put 15580
the 15581
Dormouse 15582
into 15583
the 15584
teapot. 15585
“At 15586
any 15587
rate 15588
I’ll 15589
never 15590
go 15591
_there_ 15592
again!” 15593
said 15594
Alice 15595
as 15596
she 15597
picked 15598
her 15599
way 15600
through 15601
the 15602
wood. 15603
“It’s 15604
the 15605
stupidest 15606
tea-party 15607
I 15608
ever 15609
was 15610
at 15611
in 15612
all 15613
my 15614
life!” 15615
Just 15616
as 15617
she 15618
said 15619
this, 15620
she 15621
noticed 15622
that 15623
one 15624
of 15625
the 15626
trees 15627
had 15628
a 15629
door 15630
leading 15631
right 15632
into 15633
it. 15634
“That’s 15635
very 15636
curious!” 15637
she 15638
thought. 15639
“But 15640
everything’s 15641
curious 15642
today. 15643
I 15644
think 15645
I 15646
may 15647
as 15648
well 15649
go 15650
in 15651
at 15652
once.” 15653
And 15654
in 15655
she 15656
went. 15657
Once 15658
more 15659
she 15660
found 15661
herself 15662
in 15663
the 15664
long 15665
hall, 15666
and 15667
close 15668
to 15669
the 15670
little 15671
glass 15672
table. 15673
“Now, 15674
I’ll 15675
manage 15676
better 15677
this 15678
time,” 15679
she 15680
said 15681
to 15682
herself, 15683
and 15684
began 15685
by 15686
taking 15687
the 15688
little 15689
golden 15690
key, 15691
and 15692
unlocking 15693
the 15694
door 15695
that 15696
led 15697
into 15698
the 15699
garden. 15700
Then 15701
she 15702
went 15703
to 15704
work 15705
nibbling 15706
at 15707
the 15708
mushroom 15709
(she 15710
had 15711
kept 15712
a 15713
piece 15714
of 15715
it 15716
in 15717
her 15718
pocket) 15719
till 15720
she 15721
was 15722
about 15723
a 15724
foot 15725
high: 15726
then 15727
she 15728
walked 15729
down 15730
the 15731
little 15732
passage: 15733
and 15734
_then_—she 15735
found 15736
herself 15737
at 15738
last 15739
in 15740
the 15741
beautiful 15742
garden, 15743
among 15744
the 15745
bright 15746
flower-beds 15747
and 15748
the 15749
cool 15750
fountains. 15751
CHAPTER 15752
VIII. 15753
The 15754
Queen’s 15755
Croquet-Ground 15756
A 15757
large 15758
rose-tree 15759
stood 15760
near 15761
the 15762
entrance 15763
of 15764
the 15765
garden: 15766
the 15767
roses 15768
growing 15769
on 15770
it 15771
were 15772
white, 15773
but 15774
there 15775
were 15776
three 15777
gardeners 15778
at 15779
it, 15780
busily 15781
painting 15782
them 15783
red. 15784
Alice 15785
thought 15786
this 15787
a 15788
very 15789
curious 15790
thing, 15791
and 15792
she 15793
went 15794
nearer 15795
to 15796
watch 15797
them, 15798
and 15799
just 15800
as 15801
she 15802
came 15803
up 15804
to 15805
them 15806
she 15807
heard 15808
one 15809
of 15810
them 15811
say, 15812
“Look 15813
out 15814
now, 15815
Five! 15816
Don’t 15817
go 15818
splashing 15819
paint 15820
over 15821
me 15822
like 15823
that!” 15824
“I 15825
couldn’t 15826
help 15827
it,” 15828
said 15829
Five, 15830
in 15831
a 15832
sulky 15833
tone; 15834
“Seven 15835
jogged 15836
my 15837
elbow.” 15838
On 15839
which 15840
Seven 15841
looked 15842
up 15843
and 15844
said, 15845
“That’s 15846
right, 15847
Five! 15848
Always 15849
lay 15850
the 15851
blame 15852
on 15853
others!” 15854
“_You’d_ 15855
better 15856
not 15857
talk!” 15858
said 15859
Five. 15860
“I 15861
heard 15862
the 15863
Queen 15864
say 15865
only 15866
yesterday 15867
you 15868
deserved 15869
to 15870
be 15871
beheaded!” 15872
“What 15873
for?” 15874
said 15875
the 15876
one 15877
who 15878
had 15879
spoken 15880
first. 15881
“That’s 15882
none 15883
of 15884
_your_ 15885
business, 15886
Two!” 15887
said 15888
Seven. 15889
“Yes, 15890
it 15891
_is_ 15892
his 15893
business!” 15894
said 15895
Five, 15896
“and 15897
I’ll 15898
tell 15899
him—it 15900
was 15901
for 15902
bringing 15903
the 15904
cook 15905
tulip-roots 15906
instead 15907
of 15908
onions.” 15909
Seven 15910
flung 15911
down 15912
his 15913
brush, 15914
and 15915
had 15916
just 15917
begun 15918
“Well, 15919
of 15920
all 15921
the 15922
unjust 15923
things—” 15924
when 15925
his 15926
eye 15927
chanced 15928
to 15929
fall 15930
upon 15931
Alice, 15932
as 15933
she 15934
stood 15935
watching 15936
them, 15937
and 15938
he 15939
checked 15940
himself 15941
suddenly: 15942
the 15943
others 15944
looked 15945
round 15946
also, 15947
and 15948
all 15949
of 15950
them 15951
bowed 15952
low. 15953
“Would 15954
you 15955
tell 15956
me,” 15957
said 15958
Alice, 15959
a 15960
little 15961
timidly, 15962
“why 15963
you 15964
are 15965
painting 15966
those 15967
roses?” 15968
Five 15969
and 15970
Seven 15971
said 15972
nothing, 15973
but 15974
looked 15975
at 15976
Two. 15977
Two 15978
began 15979
in 15980
a 15981
low 15982
voice, 15983
“Why 15984
the 15985
fact 15986
is, 15987
you 15988
see, 15989
Miss, 15990
this 15991
here 15992
ought 15993
to 15994
have 15995
been 15996
a 15997
_red_ 15998
rose-tree, 15999
and 16000
we 16001
put 16002
a 16003
white 16004
one 16005
in 16006
by 16007
mistake; 16008
and 16009
if 16010
the 16011
Queen 16012
was 16013
to 16014
find 16015
it 16016
out, 16017
we 16018
should 16019
all 16020
have 16021
our 16022
heads 16023
cut 16024
off, 16025
you 16026
know. 16027
So 16028
you 16029
see, 16030
Miss, 16031
we’re 16032
doing 16033
our 16034
best, 16035
afore 16036
she 16037
comes, 16038
to—” 16039
At 16040
this 16041
moment 16042
Five, 16043
who 16044
had 16045
been 16046
anxiously 16047
looking 16048
across 16049
the 16050
garden, 16051
called 16052
out 16053
“The 16054
Queen! 16055
The 16056
Queen!” 16057
and 16058
the 16059
three 16060
gardeners 16061
instantly 16062
threw 16063
themselves 16064
flat 16065
upon 16066
their 16067
faces. 16068
There 16069
was 16070
a 16071
sound 16072
of 16073
many 16074
footsteps, 16075
and 16076
Alice 16077
looked 16078
round, 16079
eager 16080
to 16081
see 16082
the 16083
Queen. 16084
First 16085
came 16086
ten 16087
soldiers 16088
carrying 16089
clubs; 16090
these 16091
were 16092
all 16093
shaped 16094
like 16095
the 16096
three 16097
gardeners, 16098
oblong 16099
and 16100
flat, 16101
with 16102
their 16103
hands 16104
and 16105
feet 16106
at 16107
the 16108
corners: 16109
next 16110
the 16111
ten 16112
courtiers; 16113
these 16114
were 16115
ornamented 16116
all 16117
over 16118
with 16119
diamonds, 16120
and 16121
walked 16122
two 16123
and 16124
two, 16125
as 16126
the 16127
soldiers 16128
did. 16129
After 16130
these 16131
came 16132
the 16133
royal 16134
children; 16135
there 16136
were 16137
ten 16138
of 16139
them, 16140
and 16141
the 16142
little 16143
dears 16144
came 16145
jumping 16146
merrily 16147
along 16148
hand 16149
in 16150
hand, 16151
in 16152
couples: 16153
they 16154
were 16155
all 16156
ornamented 16157
with 16158
hearts. 16159
Next 16160
came 16161
the 16162
guests, 16163
mostly 16164
Kings 16165
and 16166
Queens, 16167
and 16168
among 16169
them 16170
Alice 16171
recognised 16172
the 16173
White 16174
Rabbit: 16175
it 16176
was 16177
talking 16178
in 16179
a 16180
hurried 16181
nervous 16182
manner, 16183
smiling 16184
at 16185
everything 16186
that 16187
was 16188
said, 16189
and 16190
went 16191
by 16192
without 16193
noticing 16194
her. 16195
Then 16196
followed 16197
the 16198
Knave 16199
of 16200
Hearts, 16201
carrying 16202
the 16203
King’s 16204
crown 16205
on 16206
a 16207
crimson 16208
velvet 16209
cushion; 16210
and, 16211
last 16212
of 16213
all 16214
this 16215
grand 16216
procession, 16217
came 16218
THE 16219
KING 16220
AND 16221
QUEEN 16222
OF 16223
HEARTS. 16224
Alice 16225
was 16226
rather 16227
doubtful 16228
whether 16229
she 16230
ought 16231
not 16232
to 16233
lie 16234
down 16235
on 16236
her 16237
face 16238
like 16239
the 16240
three 16241
gardeners, 16242
but 16243
she 16244
could 16245
not 16246
remember 16247
ever 16248
having 16249
heard 16250
of 16251
such 16252
a 16253
rule 16254
at 16255
processions; 16256
“and 16257
besides, 16258
what 16259
would 16260
be 16261
the 16262
use 16263
of 16264
a 16265
procession,” 16266
thought 16267
she, 16268
“if 16269
people 16270
had 16271
all 16272
to 16273
lie 16274
down 16275
upon 16276
their 16277
faces, 16278
so 16279
that 16280
they 16281
couldn’t 16282
see 16283
it?” 16284
So 16285
she 16286
stood 16287
still 16288
where 16289
she 16290
was, 16291
and 16292
waited. 16293
When 16294
the 16295
procession 16296
came 16297
opposite 16298
to 16299
Alice, 16300
they 16301
all 16302
stopped 16303
and 16304
looked 16305
at 16306
her, 16307
and 16308
the 16309
Queen 16310
said 16311
severely 16312
“Who 16313
is 16314
this?” 16315
She 16316
said 16317
it 16318
to 16319
the 16320
Knave 16321
of 16322
Hearts, 16323
who 16324
only 16325
bowed 16326
and 16327
smiled 16328
in 16329
reply. 16330
“Idiot!” 16331
said 16332
the 16333
Queen, 16334
tossing 16335
her 16336
head 16337
impatiently; 16338
and, 16339
turning 16340
to 16341
Alice, 16342
she 16343
went 16344
on, 16345
“What’s 16346
your 16347
name, 16348
child?” 16349
“My 16350
name 16351
is 16352
Alice, 16353
so 16354
please 16355
your 16356
Majesty,” 16357
said 16358
Alice 16359
very 16360
politely; 16361
but 16362
she 16363
added, 16364
to 16365
herself, 16366
“Why, 16367
they’re 16368
only 16369
a 16370
pack 16371
of 16372
cards, 16373
after 16374
all. 16375
I 16376
needn’t 16377
be 16378
afraid 16379
of 16380
them!” 16381
“And 16382
who 16383
are 16384
_these?_” 16385
said 16386
the 16387
Queen, 16388
pointing 16389
to 16390
the 16391
three 16392
gardeners 16393
who 16394
were 16395
lying 16396
round 16397
the 16398
rose-tree; 16399
for, 16400
you 16401
see, 16402
as 16403
they 16404
were 16405
lying 16406
on 16407
their 16408
faces, 16409
and 16410
the 16411
pattern 16412
on 16413
their 16414
backs 16415
was 16416
the 16417
same 16418
as 16419
the 16420
rest 16421
of 16422
the 16423
pack, 16424
she 16425
could 16426
not 16427
tell 16428
whether 16429
they 16430
were 16431
gardeners, 16432
or 16433
soldiers, 16434
or 16435
courtiers, 16436
or 16437
three 16438
of 16439
her 16440
own 16441
children. 16442
“How 16443
should 16444
_I_ 16445
know?” 16446
said 16447
Alice, 16448
surprised 16449
at 16450
her 16451
own 16452
courage. 16453
“It’s 16454
no 16455
business 16456
of 16457
_mine_.” 16458
The 16459
Queen 16460
turned 16461
crimson 16462
with 16463
fury, 16464
and, 16465
after 16466
glaring 16467
at 16468
her 16469
for 16470
a 16471
moment 16472
like 16473
a 16474
wild 16475
beast, 16476
screamed 16477
“Off 16478
with 16479
her 16480
head! 16481
Off—” 16482
“Nonsense!” 16483
said 16484
Alice, 16485
very 16486
loudly 16487
and 16488
decidedly, 16489
and 16490
the 16491
Queen 16492
was 16493
silent. 16494
The 16495
King 16496
laid 16497
his 16498
hand 16499
upon 16500
her 16501
arm, 16502
and 16503
timidly 16504
said 16505
“Consider, 16506
my 16507
dear: 16508
she 16509
is 16510
only 16511
a 16512
child!” 16513
The 16514
Queen 16515
turned 16516
angrily 16517
away 16518
from 16519
him, 16520
and 16521
said 16522
to 16523
the 16524
Knave 16525
“Turn 16526
them 16527
over!” 16528
The 16529
Knave 16530
did 16531
so, 16532
very 16533
carefully, 16534
with 16535
one 16536
foot. 16537
“Get 16538
up!” 16539
said 16540
the 16541
Queen, 16542
in 16543
a 16544
shrill, 16545
loud 16546
voice, 16547
and 16548
the 16549
three 16550
gardeners 16551
instantly 16552
jumped 16553
up, 16554
and 16555
began 16556
bowing 16557
to 16558
the 16559
King, 16560
the 16561
Queen, 16562
the 16563
royal 16564
children, 16565
and 16566
everybody 16567
else. 16568
“Leave 16569
off 16570
that!” 16571
screamed 16572
the 16573
Queen. 16574
“You 16575
make 16576
me 16577
giddy.” 16578
And 16579
then, 16580
turning 16581
to 16582
the 16583
rose-tree, 16584
she 16585
went 16586
on, 16587
“What 16588
_have_ 16589
you 16590
been 16591
doing 16592
here?” 16593
“May 16594
it 16595
please 16596
your 16597
Majesty,” 16598
said 16599
Two, 16600
in 16601
a 16602
very 16603
humble 16604
tone, 16605
going 16606
down 16607
on 16608
one 16609
knee 16610
as 16611
he 16612
spoke, 16613
“we 16614
were 16615
trying—” 16616
“_I_ 16617
see!” 16618
said 16619
the 16620
Queen, 16621
who 16622
had 16623
meanwhile 16624
been 16625
examining 16626
the 16627
roses. 16628
“Off 16629
with 16630
their 16631
heads!” 16632
and 16633
the 16634
procession 16635
moved 16636
on, 16637
three 16638
of 16639
the 16640
soldiers 16641
remaining 16642
behind 16643
to 16644
execute 16645
the 16646
unfortunate 16647
gardeners, 16648
who 16649
ran 16650
to 16651
Alice 16652
for 16653
protection. 16654
“You 16655
shan’t 16656
be 16657
beheaded!” 16658
said 16659
Alice, 16660
and 16661
she 16662
put 16663
them 16664
into 16665
a 16666
large 16667
flower-pot 16668
that 16669
stood 16670
near. 16671
The 16672
three 16673
soldiers 16674
wandered 16675
about 16676
for 16677
a 16678
minute 16679
or 16680
two, 16681
looking 16682
for 16683
them, 16684
and 16685
then 16686
quietly 16687
marched 16688
off 16689
after 16690
the 16691
others. 16692
“Are 16693
their 16694
heads 16695
off?” 16696
shouted 16697
the 16698
Queen. 16699
“Their 16700
heads 16701
are 16702
gone, 16703
if 16704
it 16705
please 16706
your 16707
Majesty!” 16708
the 16709
soldiers 16710
shouted 16711
in 16712
reply. 16713
“That’s 16714
right!” 16715
shouted 16716
the 16717
Queen. 16718
“Can 16719
you 16720
play 16721
croquet?” 16722
The 16723
soldiers 16724
were 16725
silent, 16726
and 16727
looked 16728
at 16729
Alice, 16730
as 16731
the 16732
question 16733
was 16734
evidently 16735
meant 16736
for 16737
her. 16738
“Yes!” 16739
shouted 16740
Alice. 16741
“Come 16742
on, 16743
then!” 16744
roared 16745
the 16746
Queen, 16747
and 16748
Alice 16749
joined 16750
the 16751
procession, 16752
wondering 16753
very 16754
much 16755
what 16756
would 16757
happen 16758
next. 16759
“It’s—it’s 16760
a 16761
very 16762
fine 16763
day!” 16764
said 16765
a 16766
timid 16767
voice 16768
at 16769
her 16770
side. 16771
She 16772
was 16773
walking 16774
by 16775
the 16776
White 16777
Rabbit, 16778
who 16779
was 16780
peeping 16781
anxiously 16782
into 16783
her 16784
face. 16785
“Very,” 16786
said 16787
Alice: 16788
“—where’s 16789
the 16790
Duchess?” 16791
“Hush! 16792
Hush!” 16793
said 16794
the 16795
Rabbit 16796
in 16797
a 16798
low, 16799
hurried 16800
tone. 16801
He 16802
looked 16803
anxiously 16804
over 16805
his 16806
shoulder 16807
as 16808
he 16809
spoke, 16810
and 16811
then 16812
raised 16813
himself 16814
upon 16815
tiptoe, 16816
put 16817
his 16818
mouth 16819
close 16820
to 16821
her 16822
ear, 16823
and 16824
whispered 16825
“She’s 16826
under 16827
sentence 16828
of 16829
execution.” 16830
“What 16831
for?” 16832
said 16833
Alice. 16834
“Did 16835
you 16836
say 16837
‘What 16838
a 16839
pity!’?” 16840
the 16841
Rabbit 16842
asked. 16843
“No, 16844
I 16845
didn’t,” 16846
said 16847
Alice: 16848
“I 16849
don’t 16850
think 16851
it’s 16852
at 16853
all 16854
a 16855
pity. 16856
I 16857
said 16858
‘What 16859
for?’” 16860
“She 16861
boxed 16862
the 16863
Queen’s 16864
ears—” 16865
the 16866
Rabbit 16867
began. 16868
Alice 16869
gave 16870
a 16871
little 16872
scream 16873
of 16874
laughter. 16875
“Oh, 16876
hush!” 16877
the 16878
Rabbit 16879
whispered 16880
in 16881
a 16882
frightened 16883
tone. 16884
“The 16885
Queen 16886
will 16887
hear 16888
you! 16889
You 16890
see, 16891
she 16892
came 16893
rather 16894
late, 16895
and 16896
the 16897
Queen 16898
said—” 16899
“Get 16900
to 16901
your 16902
places!” 16903
shouted 16904
the 16905
Queen 16906
in 16907
a 16908
voice 16909
of 16910
thunder, 16911
and 16912
people 16913
began 16914
running 16915
about 16916
in 16917
all 16918
directions, 16919
tumbling 16920
up 16921
against 16922
each 16923
other; 16924
however, 16925
they 16926
got 16927
settled 16928
down 16929
in 16930
a 16931
minute 16932
or 16933
two, 16934
and 16935
the 16936
game 16937
began. 16938
Alice 16939
thought 16940
she 16941
had 16942
never 16943
seen 16944
such 16945
a 16946
curious 16947
croquet-ground 16948
in 16949
her 16950
life; 16951
it 16952
was 16953
all 16954
ridges 16955
and 16956
furrows; 16957
the 16958
balls 16959
were 16960
live 16961
hedgehogs, 16962
the 16963
mallets 16964
live 16965
flamingoes, 16966
and 16967
the 16968
soldiers 16969
had 16970
to 16971
double 16972
themselves 16973
up 16974
and 16975
to 16976
stand 16977
on 16978
their 16979
hands 16980
and 16981
feet, 16982
to 16983
make 16984
the 16985
arches. 16986
The 16987
chief 16988
difficulty 16989
Alice 16990
found 16991
at 16992
first 16993
was 16994
in 16995
managing 16996
her 16997
flamingo: 16998
she 16999
succeeded 17000
in 17001
getting 17002
its 17003
body 17004
tucked 17005
away, 17006
comfortably 17007
enough, 17008
under 17009
her 17010
arm, 17011
with 17012
its 17013
legs 17014
hanging 17015
down, 17016
but 17017
generally, 17018
just 17019
as 17020
she 17021
had 17022
got 17023
its 17024
neck 17025
nicely 17026
straightened 17027
out, 17028
and 17029
was 17030
going 17031
to 17032
give 17033
the 17034
hedgehog 17035
a 17036
blow 17037
with 17038
its 17039
head, 17040
it 17041
_would_ 17042
twist 17043
itself 17044
round 17045
and 17046
look 17047
up 17048
in 17049
her 17050
face, 17051
with 17052
such 17053
a 17054
puzzled 17055
expression 17056
that 17057
she 17058
could 17059
not 17060
help 17061
bursting 17062
out 17063
laughing: 17064
and 17065
when 17066
she 17067
had 17068
got 17069
its 17070
head 17071
down, 17072
and 17073
was 17074
going 17075
to 17076
begin 17077
again, 17078
it 17079
was 17080
very 17081
provoking 17082
to 17083
find 17084
that 17085
the 17086
hedgehog 17087
had 17088
unrolled 17089
itself, 17090
and 17091
was 17092
in 17093
the 17094
act 17095
of 17096
crawling 17097
away: 17098
besides 17099
all 17100
this, 17101
there 17102
was 17103
generally 17104
a 17105
ridge 17106
or 17107
furrow 17108
in 17109
the 17110
way 17111
wherever 17112
she 17113
wanted 17114
to 17115
send 17116
the 17117
hedgehog 17118
to, 17119
and, 17120
as 17121
the 17122
doubled-up 17123
soldiers 17124
were 17125
always 17126
getting 17127
up 17128
and 17129
walking 17130
off 17131
to 17132
other 17133
parts 17134
of 17135
the 17136
ground, 17137
Alice 17138
soon 17139
came 17140
to 17141
the 17142
conclusion 17143
that 17144
it 17145
was 17146
a 17147
very 17148
difficult 17149
game 17150
indeed. 17151
The 17152
players 17153
all 17154
played 17155
at 17156
once 17157
without 17158
waiting 17159
for 17160
turns, 17161
quarrelling 17162
all 17163
the 17164
while, 17165
and 17166
fighting 17167
for 17168
the 17169
hedgehogs; 17170
and 17171
in 17172
a 17173
very 17174
short 17175
time 17176
the 17177
Queen 17178
was 17179
in 17180
a 17181
furious 17182
passion, 17183
and 17184
went 17185
stamping 17186
about, 17187
and 17188
shouting 17189
“Off 17190
with 17191
his 17192
head!” 17193
or 17194
“Off 17195
with 17196
her 17197
head!” 17198
about 17199
once 17200
in 17201
a 17202
minute. 17203
Alice 17204
began 17205
to 17206
feel 17207
very 17208
uneasy: 17209
to 17210
be 17211
sure, 17212
she 17213
had 17214
not 17215
as 17216
yet 17217
had 17218
any 17219
dispute 17220
with 17221
the 17222
Queen, 17223
but 17224
she 17225
knew 17226
that 17227
it 17228
might 17229
happen 17230
any 17231
minute, 17232
“and 17233
then,” 17234
thought 17235
she, 17236
“what 17237
would 17238
become 17239
of 17240
me? 17241
They’re 17242
dreadfully 17243
fond 17244
of 17245
beheading 17246
people 17247
here; 17248
the 17249
great 17250
wonder 17251
is, 17252
that 17253
there’s 17254
any 17255
one 17256
left 17257
alive!” 17258
She 17259
was 17260
looking 17261
about 17262
for 17263
some 17264
way 17265
of 17266
escape, 17267
and 17268
wondering 17269
whether 17270
she 17271
could 17272
get 17273
away 17274
without 17275
being 17276
seen, 17277
when 17278
she 17279
noticed 17280
a 17281
curious 17282
appearance 17283
in 17284
the 17285
air: 17286
it 17287
puzzled 17288
her 17289
very 17290
much 17291
at 17292
first, 17293
but, 17294
after 17295
watching 17296
it 17297
a 17298
minute 17299
or 17300
two, 17301
she 17302
made 17303
it 17304
out 17305
to 17306
be 17307
a 17308
grin, 17309
and 17310
she 17311
said 17312
to 17313
herself 17314
“It’s 17315
the 17316
Cheshire 17317
Cat: 17318
now 17319
I 17320
shall 17321
have 17322
somebody 17323
to 17324
talk 17325
to.” 17326
“How 17327
are 17328
you 17329
getting 17330
on?” 17331
said 17332
the 17333
Cat, 17334
as 17335
soon 17336
as 17337
there 17338
was 17339
mouth 17340
enough 17341
for 17342
it 17343
to 17344
speak 17345
with. 17346
Alice 17347
waited 17348
till 17349
the 17350
eyes 17351
appeared, 17352
and 17353
then 17354
nodded. 17355
“It’s 17356
no 17357
use 17358
speaking 17359
to 17360
it,” 17361
she 17362
thought, 17363
“till 17364
its 17365
ears 17366
have 17367
come, 17368
or 17369
at 17370
least 17371
one 17372
of 17373
them.” 17374
In 17375
another 17376
minute 17377
the 17378
whole 17379
head 17380
appeared, 17381
and 17382
then 17383
Alice 17384
put 17385
down 17386
her 17387
flamingo, 17388
and 17389
began 17390
an 17391
account 17392
of 17393
the 17394
game, 17395
feeling 17396
very 17397
glad 17398
she 17399
had 17400
someone 17401
to 17402
listen 17403
to 17404
her. 17405
The 17406
Cat 17407
seemed 17408
to 17409
think 17410
that 17411
there 17412
was 17413
enough 17414
of 17415
it 17416
now 17417
in 17418
sight, 17419
and 17420
no 17421
more 17422
of 17423
it 17424
appeared. 17425
“I 17426
don’t 17427
think 17428
they 17429
play 17430
at 17431
all 17432
fairly,” 17433
Alice 17434
began, 17435
in 17436
rather 17437
a 17438
complaining 17439
tone, 17440
“and 17441
they 17442
all 17443
quarrel 17444
so 17445
dreadfully 17446
one 17447
can’t 17448
hear 17449
oneself 17450
speak—and 17451
they 17452
don’t 17453
seem 17454
to 17455
have 17456
any 17457
rules 17458
in 17459
particular; 17460
at 17461
least, 17462
if 17463
there 17464
are, 17465
nobody 17466
attends 17467
to 17468
them—and 17469
you’ve 17470
no 17471
idea 17472
how 17473
confusing 17474
it 17475
is 17476
all 17477
the 17478
things 17479
being 17480
alive; 17481
for 17482
instance, 17483
there’s 17484
the 17485
arch 17486
I’ve 17487
got 17488
to 17489
go 17490
through 17491
next 17492
walking 17493
about 17494
at 17495
the 17496
other 17497
end 17498
of 17499
the 17500
ground—and 17501
I 17502
should 17503
have 17504
croqueted 17505
the 17506
Queen’s 17507
hedgehog 17508
just 17509
now, 17510
only 17511
it 17512
ran 17513
away 17514
when 17515
it 17516
saw 17517
mine 17518
coming!” 17519
“How 17520
do 17521
you 17522
like 17523
the 17524
Queen?” 17525
said 17526
the 17527
Cat 17528
in 17529
a 17530
low 17531
voice. 17532
“Not 17533
at 17534
all,” 17535
said 17536
Alice: 17537
“she’s 17538
so 17539
extremely—” 17540
Just 17541
then 17542
she 17543
noticed 17544
that 17545
the 17546
Queen 17547
was 17548
close 17549
behind 17550
her, 17551
listening: 17552
so 17553
she 17554
went 17555
on, 17556
“—likely 17557
to 17558
win, 17559
that 17560
it’s 17561
hardly 17562
worth 17563
while 17564
finishing 17565
the 17566
game.” 17567
The 17568
Queen 17569
smiled 17570
and 17571
passed 17572
on. 17573
“Who 17574
_are_ 17575
you 17576
talking 17577
to?” 17578
said 17579
the 17580
King, 17581
going 17582
up 17583
to 17584
Alice, 17585
and 17586
looking 17587
at 17588
the 17589
Cat’s 17590
head 17591
with 17592
great 17593
curiosity. 17594
“It’s 17595
a 17596
friend 17597
of 17598
mine—a 17599
Cheshire 17600
Cat,” 17601
said 17602
Alice: 17603
“allow 17604
me 17605
to 17606
introduce 17607
it.” 17608
“I 17609
don’t 17610
like 17611
the 17612
look 17613
of 17614
it 17615
at 17616
all,” 17617
said 17618
the 17619
King: 17620
“however, 17621
it 17622
may 17623
kiss 17624
my 17625
hand 17626
if 17627
it 17628
likes.” 17629
“I’d 17630
rather 17631
not,” 17632
the 17633
Cat 17634
remarked. 17635
“Don’t 17636
be 17637
impertinent,” 17638
said 17639
the 17640
King, 17641
“and 17642
don’t 17643
look 17644
at 17645
me 17646
like 17647
that!” 17648
He 17649
got 17650
behind 17651
Alice 17652
as 17653
he 17654
spoke. 17655
“A 17656
cat 17657
may 17658
look 17659
at 17660
a 17661
king,” 17662
said 17663
Alice. 17664
“I’ve 17665
read 17666
that 17667
in 17668
some 17669
book, 17670
but 17671
I 17672
don’t 17673
remember 17674
where.” 17675
“Well, 17676
it 17677
must 17678
be 17679
removed,” 17680
said 17681
the 17682
King 17683
very 17684
decidedly, 17685
and 17686
he 17687
called 17688
the 17689
Queen, 17690
who 17691
was 17692
passing 17693
at 17694
the 17695
moment, 17696
“My 17697
dear! 17698
I 17699
wish 17700
you 17701
would 17702
have 17703
this 17704
cat 17705
removed!” 17706
The 17707
Queen 17708
had 17709
only 17710
one 17711
way 17712
of 17713
settling 17714
all 17715
difficulties, 17716
great 17717
or 17718
small. 17719
“Off 17720
with 17721
his 17722
head!” 17723
she 17724
said, 17725
without 17726
even 17727
looking 17728
round. 17729
“I’ll 17730
fetch 17731
the 17732
executioner 17733
myself,” 17734
said 17735
the 17736
King 17737
eagerly, 17738
and 17739
he 17740
hurried 17741
off. 17742
Alice 17743
thought 17744
she 17745
might 17746
as 17747
well 17748
go 17749
back, 17750
and 17751
see 17752
how 17753
the 17754
game 17755
was 17756
going 17757
on, 17758
as 17759
she 17760
heard 17761
the 17762
Queen’s 17763
voice 17764
in 17765
the 17766
distance, 17767
screaming 17768
with 17769
passion. 17770
She 17771
had 17772
already 17773
heard 17774
her 17775
sentence 17776
three 17777
of 17778
the 17779
players 17780
to 17781
be 17782
executed 17783
for 17784
having 17785
missed 17786
their 17787
turns, 17788
and 17789
she 17790
did 17791
not 17792
like 17793
the 17794
look 17795
of 17796
things 17797
at 17798
all, 17799
as 17800
the 17801
game 17802
was 17803
in 17804
such 17805
confusion 17806
that 17807
she 17808
never 17809
knew 17810
whether 17811
it 17812
was 17813
her 17814
turn 17815
or 17816
not. 17817
So 17818
she 17819
went 17820
in 17821
search 17822
of 17823
her 17824
hedgehog. 17825
The 17826
hedgehog 17827
was 17828
engaged 17829
in 17830
a 17831
fight 17832
with 17833
another 17834
hedgehog, 17835
which 17836
seemed 17837
to 17838
Alice 17839
an 17840
excellent 17841
opportunity 17842
for 17843
croqueting 17844
one 17845
of 17846
them 17847
with 17848
the 17849
other: 17850
the 17851
only 17852
difficulty 17853
was, 17854
that 17855
her 17856
flamingo 17857
was 17858
gone 17859
across 17860
to 17861
the 17862
other 17863
side 17864
of 17865
the 17866
garden, 17867
where 17868
Alice 17869
could 17870
see 17871
it 17872
trying 17873
in 17874
a 17875
helpless 17876
sort 17877
of 17878
way 17879
to 17880
fly 17881
up 17882
into 17883
a 17884
tree. 17885
By 17886
the 17887
time 17888
she 17889
had 17890
caught 17891
the 17892
flamingo 17893
and 17894
brought 17895
it 17896
back, 17897
the 17898
fight 17899
was 17900
over, 17901
and 17902
both 17903
the 17904
hedgehogs 17905
were 17906
out 17907
of 17908
sight: 17909
“but 17910
it 17911
doesn’t 17912
matter 17913
much,” 17914
thought 17915
Alice, 17916
“as 17917
all 17918
the 17919
arches 17920
are 17921
gone 17922
from 17923
this 17924
side 17925
of 17926
the 17927
ground.” 17928
So 17929
she 17930
tucked 17931
it 17932
away 17933
under 17934
her 17935
arm, 17936
that 17937
it 17938
might 17939
not 17940
escape 17941
again, 17942
and 17943
went 17944
back 17945
for 17946
a 17947
little 17948
more 17949
conversation 17950
with 17951
her 17952
friend. 17953
When 17954
she 17955
got 17956
back 17957
to 17958
the 17959
Cheshire 17960
Cat, 17961
she 17962
was 17963
surprised 17964
to 17965
find 17966
quite 17967
a 17968
large 17969
crowd 17970
collected 17971
round 17972
it: 17973
there 17974
was 17975
a 17976
dispute 17977
going 17978
on 17979
between 17980
the 17981
executioner, 17982
the 17983
King, 17984
and 17985
the 17986
Queen, 17987
who 17988
were 17989
all 17990
talking 17991
at 17992
once, 17993
while 17994
all 17995
the 17996
rest 17997
were 17998
quite 17999
silent, 18000
and 18001
looked 18002
very 18003
uncomfortable. 18004
The 18005
moment 18006
Alice 18007
appeared, 18008
she 18009
was 18010
appealed 18011
to 18012
by 18013
all 18014
three 18015
to 18016
settle 18017
the 18018
question, 18019
and 18020
they 18021
repeated 18022
their 18023
arguments 18024
to 18025
her, 18026
though, 18027
as 18028
they 18029
all 18030
spoke 18031
at 18032
once, 18033
she 18034
found 18035
it 18036
very 18037
hard 18038
indeed 18039
to 18040
make 18041
out 18042
exactly 18043
what 18044
they 18045
said. 18046
The 18047
executioner’s 18048
argument 18049
was, 18050
that 18051
you 18052
couldn’t 18053
cut 18054
off 18055
a 18056
head 18057
unless 18058
there 18059
was 18060
a 18061
body 18062
to 18063
cut 18064
it 18065
off 18066
from: 18067
that 18068
he 18069
had 18070
never 18071
had 18072
to 18073
do 18074
such 18075
a 18076
thing 18077
before, 18078
and 18079
he 18080
wasn’t 18081
going 18082
to 18083
begin 18084
at 18085
_his_ 18086
time 18087
of 18088
life. 18089
The 18090
King’s 18091
argument 18092
was, 18093
that 18094
anything 18095
that 18096
had 18097
a 18098
head 18099
could 18100
be 18101
beheaded, 18102
and 18103
that 18104
you 18105
weren’t 18106
to 18107
talk 18108
nonsense. 18109
The 18110
Queen’s 18111
argument 18112
was, 18113
that 18114
if 18115
something 18116
wasn’t 18117
done 18118
about 18119
it 18120
in 18121
less 18122
than 18123
no 18124
time 18125
she’d 18126
have 18127
everybody 18128
executed, 18129
all 18130
round. 18131
(It 18132
was 18133
this 18134
last 18135
remark 18136
that 18137
had 18138
made 18139
the 18140
whole 18141
party 18142
look 18143
so 18144
grave 18145
and 18146
anxious.) 18147
Alice 18148
could 18149
think 18150
of 18151
nothing 18152
else 18153
to 18154
say 18155
but 18156
“It 18157
belongs 18158
to 18159
the 18160
Duchess: 18161
you’d 18162
better 18163
ask 18164
_her_ 18165
about 18166
it.” 18167
“She’s 18168
in 18169
prison,” 18170
the 18171
Queen 18172
said 18173
to 18174
the 18175
executioner: 18176
“fetch 18177
her 18178
here.” 18179
And 18180
the 18181
executioner 18182
went 18183
off 18184
like 18185
an 18186
arrow. 18187
The 18188
Cat’s 18189
head 18190
began 18191
fading 18192
away 18193
the 18194
moment 18195
he 18196
was 18197
gone, 18198
and, 18199
by 18200
the 18201
time 18202
he 18203
had 18204
come 18205
back 18206
with 18207
the 18208
Duchess, 18209
it 18210
had 18211
entirely 18212
disappeared; 18213
so 18214
the 18215
King 18216
and 18217
the 18218
executioner 18219
ran 18220
wildly 18221
up 18222
and 18223
down 18224
looking 18225
for 18226
it, 18227
while 18228
the 18229
rest 18230
of 18231
the 18232
party 18233
went 18234
back 18235
to 18236
the 18237
game. 18238
CHAPTER 18239
IX. 18240
The 18241
Mock 18242
Turtle’s 18243
Story 18244
“You 18245
can’t 18246
think 18247
how 18248
glad 18249
I 18250
am 18251
to 18252
see 18253
you 18254
again, 18255
you 18256
dear 18257
old 18258
thing!” 18259
said 18260
the 18261
Duchess, 18262
as 18263
she 18264
tucked 18265
her 18266
arm 18267
affectionately 18268
into 18269
Alice’s, 18270
and 18271
they 18272
walked 18273
off 18274
together. 18275
Alice 18276
was 18277
very 18278
glad 18279
to 18280
find 18281
her 18282
in 18283
such 18284
a 18285
pleasant 18286
temper, 18287
and 18288
thought 18289
to 18290
herself 18291
that 18292
perhaps 18293
it 18294
was 18295
only 18296
the 18297
pepper 18298
that 18299
had 18300
made 18301
her 18302
so 18303
savage 18304
when 18305
they 18306
met 18307
in 18308
the 18309
kitchen. 18310
“When 18311
_I’m_ 18312
a 18313
Duchess,” 18314
she 18315
said 18316
to 18317
herself, 18318
(not 18319
in 18320
a 18321
very 18322
hopeful 18323
tone 18324
though), 18325
“I 18326
won’t 18327
have 18328
any 18329
pepper 18330
in 18331
my 18332
kitchen 18333
_at 18334
all_. 18335
Soup 18336
does 18337
very 18338
well 18339
without—Maybe 18340
it’s 18341
always 18342
pepper 18343
that 18344
makes 18345
people 18346
hot-tempered,” 18347
she 18348
went 18349
on, 18350
very 18351
much 18352
pleased 18353
at 18354
having 18355
found 18356
out 18357
a 18358
new 18359
kind 18360
of 18361
rule, 18362
“and 18363
vinegar 18364
that 18365
makes 18366
them 18367
sour—and 18368
camomile 18369
that 18370
makes 18371
them 18372
bitter—and—and 18373
barley-sugar 18374
and 18375
such 18376
things 18377
that 18378
make 18379
children 18380
sweet-tempered. 18381
I 18382
only 18383
wish 18384
people 18385
knew 18386
_that_: 18387
then 18388
they 18389
wouldn’t 18390
be 18391
so 18392
stingy 18393
about 18394
it, 18395
you 18396
know—” 18397
She 18398
had 18399
quite 18400
forgotten 18401
the 18402
Duchess 18403
by 18404
this 18405
time, 18406
and 18407
was 18408
a 18409
little 18410
startled 18411
when 18412
she 18413
heard 18414
her 18415
voice 18416
close 18417
to 18418
her 18419
ear. 18420
“You’re 18421
thinking 18422
about 18423
something, 18424
my 18425
dear, 18426
and 18427
that 18428
makes 18429
you 18430
forget 18431
to 18432
talk. 18433
I 18434
can’t 18435
tell 18436
you 18437
just 18438
now 18439
what 18440
the 18441
moral 18442
of 18443
that 18444
is, 18445
but 18446
I 18447
shall 18448
remember 18449
it 18450
in 18451
a 18452
bit.” 18453
“Perhaps 18454
it 18455
hasn’t 18456
one,” 18457
Alice 18458
ventured 18459
to 18460
remark. 18461
“Tut, 18462
tut, 18463
child!” 18464
said 18465
the 18466
Duchess. 18467
“Everything’s 18468
got 18469
a 18470
moral, 18471
if 18472
only 18473
you 18474
can 18475
find 18476
it.” 18477
And 18478
she 18479
squeezed 18480
herself 18481
up 18482
closer 18483
to 18484
Alice’s 18485
side 18486
as 18487
she 18488
spoke. 18489
Alice 18490
did 18491
not 18492
much 18493
like 18494
keeping 18495
so 18496
close 18497
to 18498
her: 18499
first, 18500
because 18501
the 18502
Duchess 18503
was 18504
_very_ 18505
ugly; 18506
and 18507
secondly, 18508
because 18509
she 18510
was 18511
exactly 18512
the 18513
right 18514
height 18515
to 18516
rest 18517
her 18518
chin 18519
upon 18520
Alice’s 18521
shoulder, 18522
and 18523
it 18524
was 18525
an 18526
uncomfortably 18527
sharp 18528
chin. 18529
However, 18530
she 18531
did 18532
not 18533
like 18534
to 18535
be 18536
rude, 18537
so 18538
she 18539
bore 18540
it 18541
as 18542
well 18543
as 18544
she 18545
could. 18546
“The 18547
game’s 18548
going 18549
on 18550
rather 18551
better 18552
now,” 18553
she 18554
said, 18555
by 18556
way 18557
of 18558
keeping 18559
up 18560
the 18561
conversation 18562
a 18563
little. 18564
“’Tis 18565
so,” 18566
said 18567
the 18568
Duchess: 18569
“and 18570
the 18571
moral 18572
of 18573
that 18574
is—‘Oh, 18575
’tis 18576
love, 18577
’tis 18578
love, 18579
that 18580
makes 18581
the 18582
world 18583
go 18584
round!’” 18585
“Somebody 18586
said,” 18587
Alice 18588
whispered, 18589
“that 18590
it’s 18591
done 18592
by 18593
everybody 18594
minding 18595
their 18596
own 18597
business!” 18598
“Ah, 18599
well! 18600
It 18601
means 18602
much 18603
the 18604
same 18605
thing,” 18606
said 18607
the 18608
Duchess, 18609
digging 18610
her 18611
sharp 18612
little 18613
chin 18614
into 18615
Alice’s 18616
shoulder 18617
as 18618
she 18619
added, 18620
“and 18621
the 18622
moral 18623
of 18624
_that_ 18625
is—‘Take 18626
care 18627
of 18628
the 18629
sense, 18630
and 18631
the 18632
sounds 18633
will 18634
take 18635
care 18636
of 18637
themselves.’” 18638
“How 18639
fond 18640
she 18641
is 18642
of 18643
finding 18644
morals 18645
in 18646
things!” 18647
Alice 18648
thought 18649
to 18650
herself. 18651
“I 18652
dare 18653
say 18654
you’re 18655
wondering 18656
why 18657
I 18658
don’t 18659
put 18660
my 18661
arm 18662
round 18663
your 18664
waist,” 18665
the 18666
Duchess 18667
said 18668
after 18669
a 18670
pause: 18671
“the 18672
reason 18673
is, 18674
that 18675
I’m 18676
doubtful 18677
about 18678
the 18679
temper 18680
of 18681
your 18682
flamingo. 18683
Shall 18684
I 18685
try 18686
the 18687
experiment?” 18688
“He 18689
might 18690
bite,” 18691
Alice 18692
cautiously 18693
replied, 18694
not 18695
feeling 18696
at 18697
all 18698
anxious 18699
to 18700
have 18701
the 18702
experiment 18703
tried. 18704
“Very 18705
true,” 18706
said 18707
the 18708
Duchess: 18709
“flamingoes 18710
and 18711
mustard 18712
both 18713
bite. 18714
And 18715
the 18716
moral 18717
of 18718
that 18719
is—‘Birds 18720
of 18721
a 18722
feather 18723
flock 18724
together.’” 18725
“Only 18726
mustard 18727
isn’t 18728
a 18729
bird,” 18730
Alice 18731
remarked. 18732
“Right, 18733
as 18734
usual,” 18735
said 18736
the 18737
Duchess: 18738
“what 18739
a 18740
clear 18741
way 18742
you 18743
have 18744
of 18745
putting 18746
things!” 18747
“It’s 18748
a 18749
mineral, 18750
I 18751
_think_,” 18752
said 18753
Alice. 18754
“Of 18755
course 18756
it 18757
is,” 18758
said 18759
the 18760
Duchess, 18761
who 18762
seemed 18763
ready 18764
to 18765
agree 18766
to 18767
everything 18768
that 18769
Alice 18770
said; 18771
“there’s 18772
a 18773
large 18774
mustard-mine 18775
near 18776
here. 18777
And 18778
the 18779
moral 18780
of 18781
that 18782
is—‘The 18783
more 18784
there 18785
is 18786
of 18787
mine, 18788
the 18789
less 18790
there 18791
is 18792
of 18793
yours.’” 18794
“Oh, 18795
I 18796
know!” 18797
exclaimed 18798
Alice, 18799
who 18800
had 18801
not 18802
attended 18803
to 18804
this 18805
last 18806
remark, 18807
“it’s 18808
a 18809
vegetable. 18810
It 18811
doesn’t 18812
look 18813
like 18814
one, 18815
but 18816
it 18817
is.” 18818
“I 18819
quite 18820
agree 18821
with 18822
you,” 18823
said 18824
the 18825
Duchess; 18826
“and 18827
the 18828
moral 18829
of 18830
that 18831
is—‘Be 18832
what 18833
you 18834
would 18835
seem 18836
to 18837
be’—or 18838
if 18839
you’d 18840
like 18841
it 18842
put 18843
more 18844
simply—‘Never 18845
imagine 18846
yourself 18847
not 18848
to 18849
be 18850
otherwise 18851
than 18852
what 18853
it 18854
might 18855
appear 18856
to 18857
others 18858
that 18859
what 18860
you 18861
were 18862
or 18863
might 18864
have 18865
been 18866
was 18867
not 18868
otherwise 18869
than 18870
what 18871
you 18872
had 18873
been 18874
would 18875
have 18876
appeared 18877
to 18878
them 18879
to 18880
be 18881
otherwise.’” 18882
“I 18883
think 18884
I 18885
should 18886
understand 18887
that 18888
better,” 18889
Alice 18890
said 18891
very 18892
politely, 18893
“if 18894
I 18895
had 18896
it 18897
written 18898
down: 18899
but 18900
I 18901
can’t 18902
quite 18903
follow 18904
it 18905
as 18906
you 18907
say 18908
it.” 18909
“That’s 18910
nothing 18911
to 18912
what 18913
I 18914
could 18915
say 18916
if 18917
I 18918
chose,” 18919
the 18920
Duchess 18921
replied, 18922
in 18923
a 18924
pleased 18925
tone. 18926
“Pray 18927
don’t 18928
trouble 18929
yourself 18930
to 18931
say 18932
it 18933
any 18934
longer 18935
than 18936
that,” 18937
said 18938
Alice. 18939
“Oh, 18940
don’t 18941
talk 18942
about 18943
trouble!” 18944
said 18945
the 18946
Duchess. 18947
“I 18948
make 18949
you 18950
a 18951
present 18952
of 18953
everything 18954
I’ve 18955
said 18956
as 18957
yet.” 18958
“A 18959
cheap 18960
sort 18961
of 18962
present!” 18963
thought 18964
Alice. 18965
“I’m 18966
glad 18967
they 18968
don’t 18969
give 18970
birthday 18971
presents 18972
like 18973
that!” 18974
But 18975
she 18976
did 18977
not 18978
venture 18979
to 18980
say 18981
it 18982
out 18983
loud. 18984
“Thinking 18985
again?” 18986
the 18987
Duchess 18988
asked, 18989
with 18990
another 18991
dig 18992
of 18993
her 18994
sharp 18995
little 18996
chin. 18997
“I’ve 18998
a 18999
right 19000
to 19001
think,” 19002
said 19003
Alice 19004
sharply, 19005
for 19006
she 19007
was 19008
beginning 19009
to 19010
feel 19011
a 19012
little 19013
worried. 19014
“Just 19015
about 19016
as 19017
much 19018
right,” 19019
said 19020
the 19021
Duchess, 19022
“as 19023
pigs 19024
have 19025
to 19026
fly; 19027
and 19028
the 19029
m—” 19030
But 19031
here, 19032
to 19033
Alice’s 19034
great 19035
surprise, 19036
the 19037
Duchess’s 19038
voice 19039
died 19040
away, 19041
even 19042
in 19043
the 19044
middle 19045
of 19046
her 19047
favourite 19048
word 19049
‘moral,’ 19050
and 19051
the 19052
arm 19053
that 19054
was 19055
linked 19056
into 19057
hers 19058
began 19059
to 19060
tremble. 19061
Alice 19062
looked 19063
up, 19064
and 19065
there 19066
stood 19067
the 19068
Queen 19069
in 19070
front 19071
of 19072
them, 19073
with 19074
her 19075
arms 19076
folded, 19077
frowning 19078
like 19079
a 19080
thunderstorm. 19081
“A 19082
fine 19083
day, 19084
your 19085
Majesty!” 19086
the 19087
Duchess 19088
began 19089
in 19090
a 19091
low, 19092
weak 19093
voice. 19094
“Now, 19095
I 19096
give 19097
you 19098
fair 19099
warning,” 19100
shouted 19101
the 19102
Queen, 19103
stamping 19104
on 19105
the 19106
ground 19107
as 19108
she 19109
spoke; 19110
“either 19111
you 19112
or 19113
your 19114
head 19115
must 19116
be 19117
off, 19118
and 19119
that 19120
in 19121
about 19122
half 19123
no 19124
time! 19125
Take 19126
your 19127
choice!” 19128
The 19129
Duchess 19130
took 19131
her 19132
choice, 19133
and 19134
was 19135
gone 19136
in 19137
a 19138
moment. 19139
“Let’s 19140
go 19141
on 19142
with 19143
the 19144
game,” 19145
the 19146
Queen 19147
said 19148
to 19149
Alice; 19150
and 19151
Alice 19152
was 19153
too 19154
much 19155
frightened 19156
to 19157
say 19158
a 19159
word, 19160
but 19161
slowly 19162
followed 19163
her 19164
back 19165
to 19166
the 19167
croquet-ground. 19168
The 19169
other 19170
guests 19171
had 19172
taken 19173
advantage 19174
of 19175
the 19176
Queen’s 19177
absence, 19178
and 19179
were 19180
resting 19181
in 19182
the 19183
shade: 19184
however, 19185
the 19186
moment 19187
they 19188
saw 19189
her, 19190
they 19191
hurried 19192
back 19193
to 19194
the 19195
game, 19196
the 19197
Queen 19198
merely 19199
remarking 19200
that 19201
a 19202
moment’s 19203
delay 19204
would 19205
cost 19206
them 19207
their 19208
lives. 19209
All 19210
the 19211
time 19212
they 19213
were 19214
playing 19215
the 19216
Queen 19217
never 19218
left 19219
off 19220
quarrelling 19221
with 19222
the 19223
other 19224
players, 19225
and 19226
shouting 19227
“Off 19228
with 19229
his 19230
head!” 19231
or 19232
“Off 19233
with 19234
her 19235
head!” 19236
Those 19237
whom 19238
she 19239
sentenced 19240
were 19241
taken 19242
into 19243
custody 19244
by 19245
the 19246
soldiers, 19247
who 19248
of 19249
course 19250
had 19251
to 19252
leave 19253
off 19254
being 19255
arches 19256
to 19257
do 19258
this, 19259
so 19260
that 19261
by 19262
the 19263
end 19264
of 19265
half 19266
an 19267
hour 19268
or 19269
so 19270
there 19271
were 19272
no 19273
arches 19274
left, 19275
and 19276
all 19277
the 19278
players, 19279
except 19280
the 19281
King, 19282
the 19283
Queen, 19284
and 19285
Alice, 19286
were 19287
in 19288
custody 19289
and 19290
under 19291
sentence 19292
of 19293
execution. 19294
Then 19295
the 19296
Queen 19297
left 19298
off, 19299
quite 19300
out 19301
of 19302
breath, 19303
and 19304
said 19305
to 19306
Alice, 19307
“Have 19308
you 19309
seen 19310
the 19311
Mock 19312
Turtle 19313
yet?” 19314
“No,” 19315
said 19316
Alice. 19317
“I 19318
don’t 19319
even 19320
know 19321
what 19322
a 19323
Mock 19324
Turtle 19325
is.” 19326
“It’s 19327
the 19328
thing 19329
Mock 19330
Turtle 19331
Soup 19332
is 19333
made 19334
from,” 19335
said 19336
the 19337
Queen. 19338
“I 19339
never 19340
saw 19341
one, 19342
or 19343
heard 19344
of 19345
one,” 19346
said 19347
Alice. 19348
“Come 19349
on, 19350
then,” 19351
said 19352
the 19353
Queen, 19354
“and 19355
he 19356
shall 19357
tell 19358
you 19359
his 19360
history.” 19361
As 19362
they 19363
walked 19364
off 19365
together, 19366
Alice 19367
heard 19368
the 19369
King 19370
say 19371
in 19372
a 19373
low 19374
voice, 19375
to 19376
the 19377
company 19378
generally, 19379
“You 19380
are 19381
all 19382
pardoned.” 19383
“Come, 19384
_that’s_ 19385
a 19386
good 19387
thing!” 19388
she 19389
said 19390
to 19391
herself, 19392
for 19393
she 19394
had 19395
felt 19396
quite 19397
unhappy 19398
at 19399
the 19400
number 19401
of 19402
executions 19403
the 19404
Queen 19405
had 19406
ordered. 19407
They 19408
very 19409
soon 19410
came 19411
upon 19412
a 19413
Gryphon, 19414
lying 19415
fast 19416
asleep 19417
in 19418
the 19419
sun. 19420
(If 19421
you 19422
don’t 19423
know 19424
what 19425
a 19426
Gryphon 19427
is, 19428
look 19429
at 19430
the 19431
picture.) 19432
“Up, 19433
lazy 19434
thing!” 19435
said 19436
the 19437
Queen, 19438
“and 19439
take 19440
this 19441
young 19442
lady 19443
to 19444
see 19445
the 19446
Mock 19447
Turtle, 19448
and 19449
to 19450
hear 19451
his 19452
history. 19453
I 19454
must 19455
go 19456
back 19457
and 19458
see 19459
after 19460
some 19461
executions 19462
I 19463
have 19464
ordered;” 19465
and 19466
she 19467
walked 19468
off, 19469
leaving 19470
Alice 19471
alone 19472
with 19473
the 19474
Gryphon. 19475
Alice 19476
did 19477
not 19478
quite 19479
like 19480
the 19481
look 19482
of 19483
the 19484
creature, 19485
but 19486
on 19487
the 19488
whole 19489
she 19490
thought 19491
it 19492
would 19493
be 19494
quite 19495
as 19496
safe 19497
to 19498
stay 19499
with 19500
it 19501
as 19502
to 19503
go 19504
after 19505
that 19506
savage 19507
Queen: 19508
so 19509
she 19510
waited. 19511
The 19512
Gryphon 19513
sat 19514
up 19515
and 19516
rubbed 19517
its 19518
eyes: 19519
then 19520
it 19521
watched 19522
the 19523
Queen 19524
till 19525
she 19526
was 19527
out 19528
of 19529
sight: 19530
then 19531
it 19532
chuckled. 19533
“What 19534
fun!” 19535
said 19536
the 19537
Gryphon, 19538
half 19539
to 19540
itself, 19541
half 19542
to 19543
Alice. 19544
“What 19545
_is_ 19546
the 19547
fun?” 19548
said 19549
Alice. 19550
“Why, 19551
_she_,” 19552
said 19553
the 19554
Gryphon. 19555
“It’s 19556
all 19557
her 19558
fancy, 19559
that: 19560
they 19561
never 19562
executes 19563
nobody, 19564
you 19565
know. 19566
Come 19567
on!” 19568
“Everybody 19569
says 19570
‘come 19571
on!’ 19572
here,” 19573
thought 19574
Alice, 19575
as 19576
she 19577
went 19578
slowly 19579
after 19580
it: 19581
“I 19582
never 19583
was 19584
so 19585
ordered 19586
about 19587
in 19588
all 19589
my 19590
life, 19591
never!” 19592
They 19593
had 19594
not 19595
gone 19596
far 19597
before 19598
they 19599
saw 19600
the 19601
Mock 19602
Turtle 19603
in 19604
the 19605
distance, 19606
sitting 19607
sad 19608
and 19609
lonely 19610
on 19611
a 19612
little 19613
ledge 19614
of 19615
rock, 19616
and, 19617
as 19618
they 19619
came 19620
nearer, 19621
Alice 19622
could 19623
hear 19624
him 19625
sighing 19626
as 19627
if 19628
his 19629
heart 19630
would 19631
break. 19632
She 19633
pitied 19634
him 19635
deeply. 19636
“What 19637
is 19638
his 19639
sorrow?” 19640
she 19641
asked 19642
the 19643
Gryphon, 19644
and 19645
the 19646
Gryphon 19647
answered, 19648
very 19649
nearly 19650
in 19651
the 19652
same 19653
words 19654
as 19655
before, 19656
“It’s 19657
all 19658
his 19659
fancy, 19660
that: 19661
he 19662
hasn’t 19663
got 19664
no 19665
sorrow, 19666
you 19667
know. 19668
Come 19669
on!” 19670
So 19671
they 19672
went 19673
up 19674
to 19675
the 19676
Mock 19677
Turtle, 19678
who 19679
looked 19680
at 19681
them 19682
with 19683
large 19684
eyes 19685
full 19686
of 19687
tears, 19688
but 19689
said 19690
nothing. 19691
“This 19692
here 19693
young 19694
lady,” 19695
said 19696
the 19697
Gryphon, 19698
“she 19699
wants 19700
for 19701
to 19702
know 19703
your 19704
history, 19705
she 19706
do.” 19707
“I’ll 19708
tell 19709
it 19710
her,” 19711
said 19712
the 19713
Mock 19714
Turtle 19715
in 19716
a 19717
deep, 19718
hollow 19719
tone: 19720
“sit 19721
down, 19722
both 19723
of 19724
you, 19725
and 19726
don’t 19727
speak 19728
a 19729
word 19730
till 19731
I’ve 19732
finished.” 19733
So 19734
they 19735
sat 19736
down, 19737
and 19738
nobody 19739
spoke 19740
for 19741
some 19742
minutes. 19743
Alice 19744
thought 19745
to 19746
herself, 19747
“I 19748
don’t 19749
see 19750
how 19751
he 19752
can 19753
_ever_ 19754
finish, 19755
if 19756
he 19757
doesn’t 19758
begin.” 19759
But 19760
she 19761
waited 19762
patiently. 19763
“Once,” 19764
said 19765
the 19766
Mock 19767
Turtle 19768
at 19769
last, 19770
with 19771
a 19772
deep 19773
sigh, 19774
“I 19775
was 19776
a 19777
real 19778
Turtle.” 19779
These 19780
words 19781
were 19782
followed 19783
by 19784
a 19785
very 19786
long 19787
silence, 19788
broken 19789
only 19790
by 19791
an 19792
occasional 19793
exclamation 19794
of 19795
“Hjckrrh!” 19796
from 19797
the 19798
Gryphon, 19799
and 19800
the 19801
constant 19802
heavy 19803
sobbing 19804
of 19805
the 19806
Mock 19807
Turtle. 19808
Alice 19809
was 19810
very 19811
nearly 19812
getting 19813
up 19814
and 19815
saying, 19816
“Thank 19817
you, 19818
sir, 19819
for 19820
your 19821
interesting 19822
story,” 19823
but 19824
she 19825
could 19826
not 19827
help 19828
thinking 19829
there 19830
_must_ 19831
be 19832
more 19833
to 19834
come, 19835
so 19836
she 19837
sat 19838
still 19839
and 19840
said 19841
nothing. 19842
“When 19843
we 19844
were 19845
little,” 19846
the 19847
Mock 19848
Turtle 19849
went 19850
on 19851
at 19852
last, 19853
more 19854
calmly, 19855
though 19856
still 19857
sobbing 19858
a 19859
little 19860
now 19861
and 19862
then, 19863
“we 19864
went 19865
to 19866
school 19867
in 19868
the 19869
sea. 19870
The 19871
master 19872
was 19873
an 19874
old 19875
Turtle—we 19876
used 19877
to 19878
call 19879
him 19880
Tortoise—” 19881
“Why 19882
did 19883
you 19884
call 19885
him 19886
Tortoise, 19887
if 19888
he 19889
wasn’t 19890
one?” 19891
Alice 19892
asked. 19893
“We 19894
called 19895
him 19896
Tortoise 19897
because 19898
he 19899
taught 19900
us,” 19901
said 19902
the 19903
Mock 19904
Turtle 19905
angrily: 19906
“really 19907
you 19908
are 19909
very 19910
dull!” 19911
“You 19912
ought 19913
to 19914
be 19915
ashamed 19916
of 19917
yourself 19918
for 19919
asking 19920
such 19921
a 19922
simple 19923
question,” 19924
added 19925
the 19926
Gryphon; 19927
and 19928
then 19929
they 19930
both 19931
sat 19932
silent 19933
and 19934
looked 19935
at 19936
poor 19937
Alice, 19938
who 19939
felt 19940
ready 19941
to 19942
sink 19943
into 19944
the 19945
earth. 19946
At 19947
last 19948
the 19949
Gryphon 19950
said 19951
to 19952
the 19953
Mock 19954
Turtle, 19955
“Drive 19956
on, 19957
old 19958
fellow! 19959
Don’t 19960
be 19961
all 19962
day 19963
about 19964
it!” 19965
and 19966
he 19967
went 19968
on 19969
in 19970
these 19971
words: 19972
“Yes, 19973
we 19974
went 19975
to 19976
school 19977
in 19978
the 19979
sea, 19980
though 19981
you 19982
mayn’t 19983
believe 19984
it—” 19985
“I 19986
never 19987
said 19988
I 19989
didn’t!” 19990
interrupted 19991
Alice. 19992
“You 19993
did,” 19994
said 19995
the 19996
Mock 19997
Turtle. 19998
“Hold 19999
your 20000
tongue!” 20001
added 20002
the 20003
Gryphon, 20004
before 20005
Alice 20006
could 20007
speak 20008
again. 20009
The 20010
Mock 20011
Turtle 20012
went 20013
on. 20014
“We 20015
had 20016
the 20017
best 20018
of 20019
educations—in 20020
fact, 20021
we 20022
went 20023
to 20024
school 20025
every 20026
day—” 20027
“_I’ve_ 20028
been 20029
to 20030
a 20031
day-school, 20032
too,” 20033
said 20034
Alice; 20035
“you 20036
needn’t 20037
be 20038
so 20039
proud 20040
as 20041
all 20042
that.” 20043
“With 20044
extras?” 20045
asked 20046
the 20047
Mock 20048
Turtle 20049
a 20050
little 20051
anxiously. 20052
“Yes,” 20053
said 20054
Alice, 20055
“we 20056
learned 20057
French 20058
and 20059
music.” 20060
“And 20061
washing?” 20062
said 20063
the 20064
Mock 20065
Turtle. 20066
“Certainly 20067
not!” 20068
said 20069
Alice 20070
indignantly. 20071
“Ah! 20072
then 20073
yours 20074
wasn’t 20075
a 20076
really 20077
good 20078
school,” 20079
said 20080
the 20081
Mock 20082
Turtle 20083
in 20084
a 20085
tone 20086
of 20087
great 20088
relief. 20089
“Now 20090
at 20091
_ours_ 20092
they 20093
had 20094
at 20095
the 20096
end 20097
of 20098
the 20099
bill, 20100
‘French, 20101
music, 20102
_and 20103
washing_—extra.’” 20104
“You 20105
couldn’t 20106
have 20107
wanted 20108
it 20109
much,” 20110
said 20111
Alice; 20112
“living 20113
at 20114
the 20115
bottom 20116
of 20117
the 20118
sea.” 20119
“I 20120
couldn’t 20121
afford 20122
to 20123
learn 20124
it.” 20125
said 20126
the 20127
Mock 20128
Turtle 20129
with 20130
a 20131
sigh. 20132
“I 20133
only 20134
took 20135
the 20136
regular 20137
course.” 20138
“What 20139
was 20140
that?” 20141
inquired 20142
Alice. 20143
“Reeling 20144
and 20145
Writhing, 20146
of 20147
course, 20148
to 20149
begin 20150
with,” 20151
the 20152
Mock 20153
Turtle 20154
replied; 20155
“and 20156
then 20157
the 20158
different 20159
branches 20160
of 20161
Arithmetic—Ambition, 20162
Distraction, 20163
Uglification, 20164
and 20165
Derision.” 20166
“I 20167
never 20168
heard 20169
of 20170
‘Uglification,’” 20171
Alice 20172
ventured 20173
to 20174
say. 20175
“What 20176
is 20177
it?” 20178
The 20179
Gryphon 20180
lifted 20181
up 20182
both 20183
its 20184
paws 20185
in 20186
surprise. 20187
“What! 20188
Never 20189
heard 20190
of 20191
uglifying!” 20192
it 20193
exclaimed. 20194
“You 20195
know 20196
what 20197
to 20198
beautify 20199
is, 20200
I 20201
suppose?” 20202
“Yes,” 20203
said 20204
Alice 20205
doubtfully: 20206
“it 20207
means—to—make—anything—prettier.” 20208
“Well, 20209
then,” 20210
the 20211
Gryphon 20212
went 20213
on, 20214
“if 20215
you 20216
don’t 20217
know 20218
what 20219
to 20220
uglify 20221
is, 20222
you 20223
_are_ 20224
a 20225
simpleton.” 20226
Alice 20227
did 20228
not 20229
feel 20230
encouraged 20231
to 20232
ask 20233
any 20234
more 20235
questions 20236
about 20237
it, 20238
so 20239
she 20240
turned 20241
to 20242
the 20243
Mock 20244
Turtle, 20245
and 20246
said 20247
“What 20248
else 20249
had 20250
you 20251
to 20252
learn?” 20253
“Well, 20254
there 20255
was 20256
Mystery,” 20257
the 20258
Mock 20259
Turtle 20260
replied, 20261
counting 20262
off 20263
the 20264
subjects 20265
on 20266
his 20267
flappers, 20268
“—Mystery, 20269
ancient 20270
and 20271
modern, 20272
with 20273
Seaography: 20274
then 20275
Drawling—the 20276
Drawling-master 20277
was 20278
an 20279
old 20280
conger-eel, 20281
that 20282
used 20283
to 20284
come 20285
once 20286
a 20287
week: 20288
_he_ 20289
taught 20290
us 20291
Drawling, 20292
Stretching, 20293
and 20294
Fainting 20295
in 20296
Coils.” 20297
“What 20298
was 20299
_that_ 20300
like?” 20301
said 20302
Alice. 20303
“Well, 20304
I 20305
can’t 20306
show 20307
it 20308
you 20309
myself,” 20310
the 20311
Mock 20312
Turtle 20313
said: 20314
“I’m 20315
too 20316
stiff. 20317
And 20318
the 20319
Gryphon 20320
never 20321
learnt 20322
it.” 20323
“Hadn’t 20324
time,” 20325
said 20326
the 20327
Gryphon: 20328
“I 20329
went 20330
to 20331
the 20332
Classics 20333
master, 20334
though. 20335
He 20336
was 20337
an 20338
old 20339
crab, 20340
_he_ 20341
was.” 20342
“I 20343
never 20344
went 20345
to 20346
him,” 20347
the 20348
Mock 20349
Turtle 20350
said 20351
with 20352
a 20353
sigh: 20354
“he 20355
taught 20356
Laughing 20357
and 20358
Grief, 20359
they 20360
used 20361
to 20362
say.” 20363
“So 20364
he 20365
did, 20366
so 20367
he 20368
did,” 20369
said 20370
the 20371
Gryphon, 20372
sighing 20373
in 20374
his 20375
turn; 20376
and 20377
both 20378
creatures 20379
hid 20380
their 20381
faces 20382
in 20383
their 20384
paws. 20385
“And 20386
how 20387
many 20388
hours 20389
a 20390
day 20391
did 20392
you 20393
do 20394
lessons?” 20395
said 20396
Alice, 20397
in 20398
a 20399
hurry 20400
to 20401
change 20402
the 20403
subject. 20404
“Ten 20405
hours 20406
the 20407
first 20408
day,” 20409
said 20410
the 20411
Mock 20412
Turtle: 20413
“nine 20414
the 20415
next, 20416
and 20417
so 20418
on.” 20419
“What 20420
a 20421
curious 20422
plan!” 20423
exclaimed 20424
Alice. 20425
“That’s 20426
the 20427
reason 20428
they’re 20429
called 20430
lessons,” 20431
the 20432
Gryphon 20433
remarked: 20434
“because 20435
they 20436
lessen 20437
from 20438
day 20439
to 20440
day.” 20441
This 20442
was 20443
quite 20444
a 20445
new 20446
idea 20447
to 20448
Alice, 20449
and 20450
she 20451
thought 20452
it 20453
over 20454
a 20455
little 20456
before 20457
she 20458
made 20459
her 20460
next 20461
remark. 20462
“Then 20463
the 20464
eleventh 20465
day 20466
must 20467
have 20468
been 20469
a 20470
holiday?” 20471
“Of 20472
course 20473
it 20474
was,” 20475
said 20476
the 20477
Mock 20478
Turtle. 20479
“And 20480
how 20481
did 20482
you 20483
manage 20484
on 20485
the 20486
twelfth?” 20487
Alice 20488
went 20489
on 20490
eagerly. 20491
“That’s 20492
enough 20493
about 20494
lessons,” 20495
the 20496
Gryphon 20497
interrupted 20498
in 20499
a 20500
very 20501
decided 20502
tone: 20503
“tell 20504
her 20505
something 20506
about 20507
the 20508
games 20509
now.” 20510
CHAPTER 20511
X. 20512
The 20513
Lobster 20514
Quadrille 20515
The 20516
Mock 20517
Turtle 20518
sighed 20519
deeply, 20520
and 20521
drew 20522
the 20523
back 20524
of 20525
one 20526
flapper 20527
across 20528
his 20529
eyes. 20530
He 20531
looked 20532
at 20533
Alice, 20534
and 20535
tried 20536
to 20537
speak, 20538
but 20539
for 20540
a 20541
minute 20542
or 20543
two 20544
sobs 20545
choked 20546
his 20547
voice. 20548
“Same 20549
as 20550
if 20551
he 20552
had 20553
a 20554
bone 20555
in 20556
his 20557
throat,” 20558
said 20559
the 20560
Gryphon: 20561
and 20562
it 20563
set 20564
to 20565
work 20566
shaking 20567
him 20568
and 20569
punching 20570
him 20571
in 20572
the 20573
back. 20574
At 20575
last 20576
the 20577
Mock 20578
Turtle 20579
recovered 20580
his 20581
voice, 20582
and, 20583
with 20584
tears 20585
running 20586
down 20587
his 20588
cheeks, 20589
he 20590
went 20591
on 20592
again:— 20593
“You 20594
may 20595
not 20596
have 20597
lived 20598
much 20599
under 20600
the 20601
sea—” 20602
(“I 20603
haven’t,” 20604
said 20605
Alice)—“and 20606
perhaps 20607
you 20608
were 20609
never 20610
even 20611
introduced 20612
to 20613
a 20614
lobster—” 20615
(Alice 20616
began 20617
to 20618
say 20619
“I 20620
once 20621
tasted—” 20622
but 20623
checked 20624
herself 20625
hastily, 20626
and 20627
said 20628
“No, 20629
never”) 20630
“—so 20631
you 20632
can 20633
have 20634
no 20635
idea 20636
what 20637
a 20638
delightful 20639
thing 20640
a 20641
Lobster 20642
Quadrille 20643
is!” 20644
“No, 20645
indeed,” 20646
said 20647
Alice. 20648
“What 20649
sort 20650
of 20651
a 20652
dance 20653
is 20654
it?” 20655
“Why,” 20656
said 20657
the 20658
Gryphon, 20659
“you 20660
first 20661
form 20662
into 20663
a 20664
line 20665
along 20666
the 20667
sea-shore—” 20668
“Two 20669
lines!” 20670
cried 20671
the 20672
Mock 20673
Turtle. 20674
“Seals, 20675
turtles, 20676
salmon, 20677
and 20678
so 20679
on; 20680
then, 20681
when 20682
you’ve 20683
cleared 20684
all 20685
the 20686
jelly-fish 20687
out 20688
of 20689
the 20690
way—” 20691
“_That_ 20692
generally 20693
takes 20694
some 20695
time,” 20696
interrupted 20697
the 20698
Gryphon. 20699
“—you 20700
advance 20701
twice—” 20702
“Each 20703
with 20704
a 20705
lobster 20706
as 20707
a 20708
partner!” 20709
cried 20710
the 20711
Gryphon. 20712
“Of 20713
course,” 20714
the 20715
Mock 20716
Turtle 20717
said: 20718
“advance 20719
twice, 20720
set 20721
to 20722
partners—” 20723
“—change 20724
lobsters, 20725
and 20726
retire 20727
in 20728
same 20729
order,” 20730
continued 20731
the 20732
Gryphon. 20733
“Then, 20734
you 20735
know,” 20736
the 20737
Mock 20738
Turtle 20739
went 20740
on, 20741
“you 20742
throw 20743
the—” 20744
“The 20745
lobsters!” 20746
shouted 20747
the 20748
Gryphon, 20749
with 20750
a 20751
bound 20752
into 20753
the 20754
air. 20755
“—as 20756
far 20757
out 20758
to 20759
sea 20760
as 20761
you 20762
can—” 20763
“Swim 20764
after 20765
them!” 20766
screamed 20767
the 20768
Gryphon. 20769
“Turn 20770
a 20771
somersault 20772
in 20773
the 20774
sea!” 20775
cried 20776
the 20777
Mock 20778
Turtle, 20779
capering 20780
wildly 20781
about. 20782
“Change 20783
lobsters 20784
again!” 20785
yelled 20786
the 20787
Gryphon 20788
at 20789
the 20790
top 20791
of 20792
its 20793
voice. 20794
“Back 20795
to 20796
land 20797
again, 20798
and 20799
that’s 20800
all 20801
the 20802
first 20803
figure,” 20804
said 20805
the 20806
Mock 20807
Turtle, 20808
suddenly 20809
dropping 20810
his 20811
voice; 20812
and 20813
the 20814
two 20815
creatures, 20816
who 20817
had 20818
been 20819
jumping 20820
about 20821
like 20822
mad 20823
things 20824
all 20825
this 20826
time, 20827
sat 20828
down 20829
again 20830
very 20831
sadly 20832
and 20833
quietly, 20834
and 20835
looked 20836
at 20837
Alice. 20838
“It 20839
must 20840
be 20841
a 20842
very 20843
pretty 20844
dance,” 20845
said 20846
Alice 20847
timidly. 20848
“Would 20849
you 20850
like 20851
to 20852
see 20853
a 20854
little 20855
of 20856
it?” 20857
said 20858
the 20859
Mock 20860
Turtle. 20861
“Very 20862
much 20863
indeed,” 20864
said 20865
Alice. 20866
“Come, 20867
let’s 20868
try 20869
the 20870
first 20871
figure!” 20872
said 20873
the 20874
Mock 20875
Turtle 20876
to 20877
the 20878
Gryphon. 20879
“We 20880
can 20881
do 20882
without 20883
lobsters, 20884
you 20885
know. 20886
Which 20887
shall 20888
sing?” 20889
“Oh, 20890
_you_ 20891
sing,” 20892
said 20893
the 20894
Gryphon. 20895
“I’ve 20896
forgotten 20897
the 20898
words.” 20899
So 20900
they 20901
began 20902
solemnly 20903
dancing 20904
round 20905
and 20906
round 20907
Alice, 20908
every 20909
now 20910
and 20911
then 20912
treading 20913
on 20914
her 20915
toes 20916
when 20917
they 20918
passed 20919
too 20920
close, 20921
and 20922
waving 20923
their 20924
forepaws 20925
to 20926
mark 20927
the 20928
time, 20929
while 20930
the 20931
Mock 20932
Turtle 20933
sang 20934
this, 20935
very 20936
slowly 20937
and 20938
sadly:— 20939
“Will 20940
you 20941
walk 20942
a 20943
little 20944
faster?” 20945
said 20946
a 20947
whiting 20948
to 20949
a 20950
snail. 20951
“There’s 20952
a 20953
porpoise 20954
close 20955
behind 20956
us, 20957
and 20958
he’s 20959
treading 20960
on 20961
my 20962
tail. 20963
See 20964
how 20965
eagerly 20966
the 20967
lobsters 20968
and 20969
the 20970
turtles 20971
all 20972
advance! 20973
They 20974
are 20975
waiting 20976
on 20977
the 20978
shingle—will 20979
you 20980
come 20981
and 20982
join 20983
the 20984
dance? 20985
Will 20986
you, 20987
won’t 20988
you, 20989
will 20990
you, 20991
won’t 20992
you, 20993
will 20994
you 20995
join 20996
the 20997
dance? 20998
Will 20999
you, 21000
won’t 21001
you, 21002
will 21003
you, 21004
won’t 21005
you, 21006
won’t 21007
you 21008
join 21009
the 21010
dance? 21011
“You 21012
can 21013
really 21014
have 21015
no 21016
notion 21017
how 21018
delightful 21019
it 21020
will 21021
be 21022
When 21023
they 21024
take 21025
us 21026
up 21027
and 21028
throw 21029
us, 21030
with 21031
the 21032
lobsters, 21033
out 21034
to 21035
sea!” 21036
But 21037
the 21038
snail 21039
replied 21040
“Too 21041
far, 21042
too 21043
far!” 21044
and 21045
gave 21046
a 21047
look 21048
askance— 21049
Said 21050
he 21051
thanked 21052
the 21053
whiting 21054
kindly, 21055
but 21056
he 21057
would 21058
not 21059
join 21060
the 21061
dance. 21062
Would 21063
not, 21064
could 21065
not, 21066
would 21067
not, 21068
could 21069
not, 21070
would 21071
not 21072
join 21073
the 21074
dance. 21075
Would 21076
not, 21077
could 21078
not, 21079
would 21080
not, 21081
could 21082
not, 21083
could 21084
not 21085
join 21086
the 21087
dance. 21088
“What 21089
matters 21090
it 21091
how 21092
far 21093
we 21094
go?” 21095
his 21096
scaly 21097
friend 21098
replied. 21099
“There 21100
is 21101
another 21102
shore, 21103
you 21104
know, 21105
upon 21106
the 21107
other 21108
side. 21109
The 21110
further 21111
off 21112
from 21113
England 21114
the 21115
nearer 21116
is 21117
to 21118
France— 21119
Then 21120
turn 21121
not 21122
pale, 21123
beloved 21124
snail, 21125
but 21126
come 21127
and 21128
join 21129
the 21130
dance. 21131
Will 21132
you, 21133
won’t 21134
you, 21135
will 21136
you, 21137
won’t 21138
you, 21139
will 21140
you 21141
join 21142
the 21143
dance? 21144
Will 21145
you, 21146
won’t 21147
you, 21148
will 21149
you, 21150
won’t 21151
you, 21152
won’t 21153
you 21154
join 21155
the 21156
dance?” 21157
“Thank 21158
you, 21159
it’s 21160
a 21161
very 21162
interesting 21163
dance 21164
to 21165
watch,” 21166
said 21167
Alice, 21168
feeling 21169
very 21170
glad 21171
that 21172
it 21173
was 21174
over 21175
at 21176
last: 21177
“and 21178
I 21179
do 21180
so 21181
like 21182
that 21183
curious 21184
song 21185
about 21186
the 21187
whiting!” 21188
“Oh, 21189
as 21190
to 21191
the 21192
whiting,” 21193
said 21194
the 21195
Mock 21196
Turtle, 21197
“they—you’ve 21198
seen 21199
them, 21200
of 21201
course?” 21202
“Yes,” 21203
said 21204
Alice, 21205
“I’ve 21206
often 21207
seen 21208
them 21209
at 21210
dinn—” 21211
she 21212
checked 21213
herself 21214
hastily. 21215
“I 21216
don’t 21217
know 21218
where 21219
Dinn 21220
may 21221
be,” 21222
said 21223
the 21224
Mock 21225
Turtle, 21226
“but 21227
if 21228
you’ve 21229
seen 21230
them 21231
so 21232
often, 21233
of 21234
course 21235
you 21236
know 21237
what 21238
they’re 21239
like.” 21240
“I 21241
believe 21242
so,” 21243
Alice 21244
replied 21245
thoughtfully. 21246
“They 21247
have 21248
their 21249
tails 21250
in 21251
their 21252
mouths—and 21253
they’re 21254
all 21255
over 21256
crumbs.” 21257
“You’re 21258
wrong 21259
about 21260
the 21261
crumbs,” 21262
said 21263
the 21264
Mock 21265
Turtle: 21266
“crumbs 21267
would 21268
all 21269
wash 21270
off 21271
in 21272
the 21273
sea. 21274
But 21275
they 21276
_have_ 21277
their 21278
tails 21279
in 21280
their 21281
mouths; 21282
and 21283
the 21284
reason 21285
is—” 21286
here 21287
the 21288
Mock 21289
Turtle 21290
yawned 21291
and 21292
shut 21293
his 21294
eyes.—“Tell 21295
her 21296
about 21297
the 21298
reason 21299
and 21300
all 21301
that,” 21302
he 21303
said 21304
to 21305
the 21306
Gryphon. 21307
“The 21308
reason 21309
is,” 21310
said 21311
the 21312
Gryphon, 21313
“that 21314
they 21315
_would_ 21316
go 21317
with 21318
the 21319
lobsters 21320
to 21321
the 21322
dance. 21323
So 21324
they 21325
got 21326
thrown 21327
out 21328
to 21329
sea. 21330
So 21331
they 21332
had 21333
to 21334
fall 21335
a 21336
long 21337
way. 21338
So 21339
they 21340
got 21341
their 21342
tails 21343
fast 21344
in 21345
their 21346
mouths. 21347
So 21348
they 21349
couldn’t 21350
get 21351
them 21352
out 21353
again. 21354
That’s 21355
all.” 21356
“Thank 21357
you,” 21358
said 21359
Alice, 21360
“it’s 21361
very 21362
interesting. 21363
I 21364
never 21365
knew 21366
so 21367
much 21368
about 21369
a 21370
whiting 21371
before.” 21372
“I 21373
can 21374
tell 21375
you 21376
more 21377
than 21378
that, 21379
if 21380
you 21381
like,” 21382
said 21383
the 21384
Gryphon. 21385
“Do 21386
you 21387
know 21388
why 21389
it’s 21390
called 21391
a 21392
whiting?” 21393
“I 21394
never 21395
thought 21396
about 21397
it,” 21398
said 21399
Alice. 21400
“Why?” 21401
“_It 21402
does 21403
the 21404
boots 21405
and 21406
shoes_,” 21407
the 21408
Gryphon 21409
replied 21410
very 21411
solemnly. 21412
Alice 21413
was 21414
thoroughly 21415
puzzled. 21416
“Does 21417
the 21418
boots 21419
and 21420
shoes!” 21421
she 21422
repeated 21423
in 21424
a 21425
wondering 21426
tone. 21427
“Why, 21428
what 21429
are 21430
_your_ 21431
shoes 21432
done 21433
with?” 21434
said 21435
the 21436
Gryphon. 21437
“I 21438
mean, 21439
what 21440
makes 21441
them 21442
so 21443
shiny?” 21444
Alice 21445
looked 21446
down 21447
at 21448
them, 21449
and 21450
considered 21451
a 21452
little 21453
before 21454
she 21455
gave 21456
her 21457
answer. 21458
“They’re 21459
done 21460
with 21461
blacking, 21462
I 21463
believe.” 21464
“Boots 21465
and 21466
shoes 21467
under 21468
the 21469
sea,” 21470
the 21471
Gryphon 21472
went 21473
on 21474
in 21475
a 21476
deep 21477
voice, 21478
“are 21479
done 21480
with 21481
a 21482
whiting. 21483
Now 21484
you 21485
know.” 21486
“And 21487
what 21488
are 21489
they 21490
made 21491
of?” 21492
Alice 21493
asked 21494
in 21495
a 21496
tone 21497
of 21498
great 21499
curiosity. 21500
“Soles 21501
and 21502
eels, 21503
of 21504
course,” 21505
the 21506
Gryphon 21507
replied 21508
rather 21509
impatiently: 21510
“any 21511
shrimp 21512
could 21513
have 21514
told 21515
you 21516
that.” 21517
“If 21518
I’d 21519
been 21520
the 21521
whiting,” 21522
said 21523
Alice, 21524
whose 21525
thoughts 21526
were 21527
still 21528
running 21529
on 21530
the 21531
song, 21532
“I’d 21533
have 21534
said 21535
to 21536
the 21537
porpoise, 21538
‘Keep 21539
back, 21540
please: 21541
we 21542
don’t 21543
want 21544
_you_ 21545
with 21546
us!’” 21547
“They 21548
were 21549
obliged 21550
to 21551
have 21552
him 21553
with 21554
them,” 21555
the 21556
Mock 21557
Turtle 21558
said: 21559
“no 21560
wise 21561
fish 21562
would 21563
go 21564
anywhere 21565
without 21566
a 21567
porpoise.” 21568
“Wouldn’t 21569
it 21570
really?” 21571
said 21572
Alice 21573
in 21574
a 21575
tone 21576
of 21577
great 21578
surprise. 21579
“Of 21580
course 21581
not,” 21582
said 21583
the 21584
Mock 21585
Turtle: 21586
“why, 21587
if 21588
a 21589
fish 21590
came 21591
to 21592
_me_, 21593
and 21594
told 21595
me 21596
he 21597
was 21598
going 21599
a 21600
journey, 21601
I 21602
should 21603
say 21604
‘With 21605
what 21606
porpoise?’” 21607
“Don’t 21608
you 21609
mean 21610
‘purpose’?” 21611
said 21612
Alice. 21613
“I 21614
mean 21615
what 21616
I 21617
say,” 21618
the 21619
Mock 21620
Turtle 21621
replied 21622
in 21623
an 21624
offended 21625
tone. 21626
And 21627
the 21628
Gryphon 21629
added 21630
“Come, 21631
let’s 21632
hear 21633
some 21634
of 21635
_your_ 21636
adventures.” 21637
“I 21638
could 21639
tell 21640
you 21641
my 21642
adventures—beginning 21643
from 21644
this 21645
morning,” 21646
said 21647
Alice 21648
a 21649
little 21650
timidly: 21651
“but 21652
it’s 21653
no 21654
use 21655
going 21656
back 21657
to 21658
yesterday, 21659
because 21660
I 21661
was 21662
a 21663
different 21664
person 21665
then.” 21666
“Explain 21667
all 21668
that,” 21669
said 21670
the 21671
Mock 21672
Turtle. 21673
“No, 21674
no! 21675
The 21676
adventures 21677
first,” 21678
said 21679
the 21680
Gryphon 21681
in 21682
an 21683
impatient 21684
tone: 21685
“explanations 21686
take 21687
such 21688
a 21689
dreadful 21690
time.” 21691
So 21692
Alice 21693
began 21694
telling 21695
them 21696
her 21697
adventures 21698
from 21699
the 21700
time 21701
when 21702
she 21703
first 21704
saw 21705
the 21706
White 21707
Rabbit. 21708
She 21709
was 21710
a 21711
little 21712
nervous 21713
about 21714
it 21715
just 21716
at 21717
first, 21718
the 21719
two 21720
creatures 21721
got 21722
so 21723
close 21724
to 21725
her, 21726
one 21727
on 21728
each 21729
side, 21730
and 21731
opened 21732
their 21733
eyes 21734
and 21735
mouths 21736
so 21737
_very_ 21738
wide, 21739
but 21740
she 21741
gained 21742
courage 21743
as 21744
she 21745
went 21746
on. 21747
Her 21748
listeners 21749
were 21750
perfectly 21751
quiet 21752
till 21753
she 21754
got 21755
to 21756
the 21757
part 21758
about 21759
her 21760
repeating 21761
“_You 21762
are 21763
old, 21764
Father 21765
William_,” 21766
to 21767
the 21768
Caterpillar, 21769
and 21770
the 21771
words 21772
all 21773
coming 21774
different, 21775
and 21776
then 21777
the 21778
Mock 21779
Turtle 21780
drew 21781
a 21782
long 21783
breath, 21784
and 21785
said 21786
“That’s 21787
very 21788
curious.” 21789
“It’s 21790
all 21791
about 21792
as 21793
curious 21794
as 21795
it 21796
can 21797
be,” 21798
said 21799
the 21800
Gryphon. 21801
“It 21802
all 21803
came 21804
different!” 21805
the 21806
Mock 21807
Turtle 21808
repeated 21809
thoughtfully. 21810
“I 21811
should 21812
like 21813
to 21814
hear 21815
her 21816
try 21817
and 21818
repeat 21819
something 21820
now. 21821
Tell 21822
her 21823
to 21824
begin.” 21825
He 21826
looked 21827
at 21828
the 21829
Gryphon 21830
as 21831
if 21832
he 21833
thought 21834
it 21835
had 21836
some 21837
kind 21838
of 21839
authority 21840
over 21841
Alice. 21842
“Stand 21843
up 21844
and 21845
repeat 21846
‘’_Tis 21847
the 21848
voice 21849
of 21850
the 21851
sluggard_,’” 21852
said 21853
the 21854
Gryphon. 21855
“How 21856
the 21857
creatures 21858
order 21859
one 21860
about, 21861
and 21862
make 21863
one 21864
repeat 21865
lessons!” 21866
thought 21867
Alice; 21868
“I 21869
might 21870
as 21871
well 21872
be 21873
at 21874
school 21875
at 21876
once.” 21877
However, 21878
she 21879
got 21880
up, 21881
and 21882
began 21883
to 21884
repeat 21885
it, 21886
but 21887
her 21888
head 21889
was 21890
so 21891
full 21892
of 21893
the 21894
Lobster 21895
Quadrille, 21896
that 21897
she 21898
hardly 21899
knew 21900
what 21901
she 21902
was 21903
saying, 21904
and 21905
the 21906
words 21907
came 21908
very 21909
queer 21910
indeed:— 21911
“’Tis 21912
the 21913
voice 21914
of 21915
the 21916
Lobster; 21917
I 21918
heard 21919
him 21920
declare, 21921
“You 21922
have 21923
baked 21924
me 21925
too 21926
brown, 21927
I 21928
must 21929
sugar 21930
my 21931
hair.” 21932
As 21933
a 21934
duck 21935
with 21936
its 21937
eyelids, 21938
so 21939
he 21940
with 21941
his 21942
nose 21943
Trims 21944
his 21945
belt 21946
and 21947
his 21948
buttons, 21949
and 21950
turns 21951
out 21952
his 21953
toes.” 21954
[later 21955
editions 21956
continued 21957
as 21958
follows 21959
When 21960
the 21961
sands 21962
are 21963
all 21964
dry, 21965
he 21966
is 21967
gay 21968
as 21969
a 21970
lark, 21971
And 21972
will 21973
talk 21974
in 21975
contemptuous 21976
tones 21977
of 21978
the 21979
Shark, 21980
But, 21981
when 21982
the 21983
tide 21984
rises 21985
and 21986
sharks 21987
are 21988
around, 21989
His 21990
voice 21991
has 21992
a 21993
timid 21994
and 21995
tremulous 21996
sound.] 21997
“That’s 21998
different 21999
from 22000
what 22001
_I_ 22002
used 22003
to 22004
say 22005
when 22006
I 22007
was 22008
a 22009
child,” 22010
said 22011
the 22012
Gryphon. 22013
“Well, 22014
I 22015
never 22016
heard 22017
it 22018
before,” 22019
said 22020
the 22021
Mock 22022
Turtle; 22023
“but 22024
it 22025
sounds 22026
uncommon 22027
nonsense.” 22028
Alice 22029
said 22030
nothing; 22031
she 22032
had 22033
sat 22034
down 22035
with 22036
her 22037
face 22038
in 22039
her 22040
hands, 22041
wondering 22042
if 22043
anything 22044
would 22045
_ever_ 22046
happen 22047
in 22048
a 22049
natural 22050
way 22051
again. 22052
“I 22053
should 22054
like 22055
to 22056
have 22057
it 22058
explained,” 22059
said 22060
the 22061
Mock 22062
Turtle. 22063
“She 22064
can’t 22065
explain 22066
it,” 22067
said 22068
the 22069
Gryphon 22070
hastily. 22071
“Go 22072
on 22073
with 22074
the 22075
next 22076
verse.” 22077
“But 22078
about 22079
his 22080
toes?” 22081
the 22082
Mock 22083
Turtle 22084
persisted. 22085
“How 22086
_could_ 22087
he 22088
turn 22089
them 22090
out 22091
with 22092
his 22093
nose, 22094
you 22095
know?” 22096
“It’s 22097
the 22098
first 22099
position 22100
in 22101
dancing.” 22102
Alice 22103
said; 22104
but 22105
was 22106
dreadfully 22107
puzzled 22108
by 22109
the 22110
whole 22111
thing, 22112
and 22113
longed 22114
to 22115
change 22116
the 22117
subject. 22118
“Go 22119
on 22120
with 22121
the 22122
next 22123
verse,” 22124
the 22125
Gryphon 22126
repeated 22127
impatiently: 22128
“it 22129
begins 22130
‘_I 22131
passed 22132
by 22133
his 22134
garden_.’” 22135
Alice 22136
did 22137
not 22138
dare 22139
to 22140
disobey, 22141
though 22142
she 22143
felt 22144
sure 22145
it 22146
would 22147
all 22148
come 22149
wrong, 22150
and 22151
she 22152
went 22153
on 22154
in 22155
a 22156
trembling 22157
voice:— 22158
“I 22159
passed 22160
by 22161
his 22162
garden, 22163
and 22164
marked, 22165
with 22166
one 22167
eye, 22168
How 22169
the 22170
Owl 22171
and 22172
the 22173
Panther 22174
were 22175
sharing 22176
a 22177
pie—” 22178
[later 22179
editions 22180
continued 22181
as 22182
follows 22183
The 22184
Panther 22185
took 22186
pie-crust, 22187
and 22188
gravy, 22189
and 22190
meat, 22191
While 22192
the 22193
Owl 22194
had 22195
the 22196
dish 22197
as 22198
its 22199
share 22200
of 22201
the 22202
treat. 22203
When 22204
the 22205
pie 22206
was 22207
all 22208
finished, 22209
the 22210
Owl, 22211
as 22212
a 22213
boon, 22214
Was 22215
kindly 22216
permitted 22217
to 22218
pocket 22219
the 22220
spoon: 22221
While 22222
the 22223
Panther 22224
received 22225
knife 22226
and 22227
fork 22228
with 22229
a 22230
growl, 22231
And 22232
concluded 22233
the 22234
banquet—] 22235
“What 22236
_is_ 22237
the 22238
use 22239
of 22240
repeating 22241
all 22242
that 22243
stuff,” 22244
the 22245
Mock 22246
Turtle 22247
interrupted, 22248
“if 22249
you 22250
don’t 22251
explain 22252
it 22253
as 22254
you 22255
go 22256
on? 22257
It’s 22258
by 22259
far 22260
the 22261
most 22262
confusing 22263
thing 22264
_I_ 22265
ever 22266
heard!” 22267
“Yes, 22268
I 22269
think 22270
you’d 22271
better 22272
leave 22273
off,” 22274
said 22275
the 22276
Gryphon: 22277
and 22278
Alice 22279
was 22280
only 22281
too 22282
glad 22283
to 22284
do 22285
so. 22286
“Shall 22287
we 22288
try 22289
another 22290
figure 22291
of 22292
the 22293
Lobster 22294
Quadrille?” 22295
the 22296
Gryphon 22297
went 22298
on. 22299
“Or 22300
would 22301
you 22302
like 22303
the 22304
Mock 22305
Turtle 22306
to 22307
sing 22308
you 22309
a 22310
song?” 22311
“Oh, 22312
a 22313
song, 22314
please, 22315
if 22316
the 22317
Mock 22318
Turtle 22319
would 22320
be 22321
so 22322
kind,” 22323
Alice 22324
replied, 22325
so 22326
eagerly 22327
that 22328
the 22329
Gryphon 22330
said, 22331
in 22332
a 22333
rather 22334
offended 22335
tone, 22336
“Hm! 22337
No 22338
accounting 22339
for 22340
tastes! 22341
Sing 22342
her 22343
‘_Turtle 22344
Soup_,’ 22345
will 22346
you, 22347
old 22348
fellow?” 22349
The 22350
Mock 22351
Turtle 22352
sighed 22353
deeply, 22354
and 22355
began, 22356
in 22357
a 22358
voice 22359
sometimes 22360
choked 22361
with 22362
sobs, 22363
to 22364
sing 22365
this:— 22366
“Beautiful 22367

and 22371

“Chorus 22449
again!” 22450
cried 22451
the 22452
Gryphon, 22453
and 22454
the 22455
Mock 22456
Turtle 22457
had 22458
just 22459
begun 22460
to 22461
repeat 22462
it, 22463
when 22464
a 22465
cry 22466
of 22467
“The 22468
trial’s 22469
beginning!” 22470
was 22471
heard 22472
in 22473
the 22474
distance. 22475
“Come 22476
on!” 22477
cried 22478
the 22479
Gryphon, 22480
and, 22481
taking 22482
Alice 22483
by 22484
the 22485
hand, 22486
it 22487
hurried 22488
off, 22489
without 22490
waiting 22491
for 22492
the 22493
end 22494
of 22495
the 22496
song. 22497
“What 22498
trial 22499
is 22500
it?” 22501
Alice 22502
panted 22503
as 22504
she 22505
ran; 22506
but 22507
the 22508
Gryphon 22509
only 22510
answered 22511
“Come 22512
on!” 22513
and 22514
ran 22515
the 22516
faster, 22517
while 22518
more 22519
and 22520
more 22521
faintly 22522
came, 22523
carried 22524
on 22525
the 22526
breeze 22527
that 22528
followed 22529
them, 22530
the 22531
melancholy 22532
words:— 22533
“Soo—oop 22534
of 22535
the 22536
e—e—evening, 22537
Beautiful, 22538
beautiful 22539
Soup!” 22540
CHAPTER 22541
XI. 22542
Who 22543
Stole 22544
the 22545
Tarts? 22546
The 22547
King 22548
and 22549
Queen 22550
of 22551
Hearts 22552
were 22553
seated 22554
on 22555
their 22556
throne 22557
when 22558
they 22559
arrived, 22560
with 22561
a 22562
great 22563
crowd 22564
assembled 22565
about 22566
them—all 22567
sorts 22568
of 22569
little 22570
birds 22571
and 22572
beasts, 22573
as 22574
well 22575
as 22576
the 22577
whole 22578
pack 22579
of 22580
cards: 22581
the 22582
Knave 22583
was 22584
standing 22585
before 22586
them, 22587
in 22588
chains, 22589
with 22590
a 22591
soldier 22592
on 22593
each 22594
side 22595
to 22596
guard 22597
him; 22598
and 22599
near 22600
the 22601
King 22602
was 22603
the 22604
White 22605
Rabbit, 22606
with 22607
a 22608
trumpet 22609
in 22610
one 22611
hand, 22612
and 22613
a 22614
scroll 22615
of 22616
parchment 22617
in 22618
the 22619
other. 22620
In 22621
the 22622
very 22623
middle 22624
of 22625
the 22626
court 22627
was 22628
a 22629
table, 22630
with 22631
a 22632
large 22633
dish 22634
of 22635
tarts 22636
upon 22637
it: 22638
they 22639
looked 22640
so 22641
good, 22642
that 22643
it 22644
made 22645
Alice 22646
quite 22647
hungry 22648
to 22649
look 22650
at 22651
them—“I 22652
wish 22653
they’d 22654
get 22655
the 22656
trial 22657
done,” 22658
she 22659
thought, 22660
“and 22661
hand 22662
round 22663
the 22664
refreshments!” 22665
But 22666
there 22667
seemed 22668
to 22669
be 22670
no 22671
chance 22672
of 22673
this, 22674
so 22675
she 22676
began 22677
looking 22678
at 22679
everything 22680
about 22681
her, 22682
to 22683
pass 22684
away 22685
the 22686
time. 22687
Alice 22688
had 22689
never 22690
been 22691
in 22692
a 22693
court 22694
of 22695
justice 22696
before, 22697
but 22698
she 22699
had 22700
read 22701
about 22702
them 22703
in 22704
books, 22705
and 22706
she 22707
was 22708
quite 22709
pleased 22710
to 22711
find 22712
that 22713
she 22714
knew 22715
the 22716
name 22717
of 22718
nearly 22719
everything 22720
there. 22721
“That’s 22722
the 22723
judge,” 22724
she 22725
said 22726
to 22727
herself, 22728
“because 22729
of 22730
his 22731
great 22732
wig.” 22733
The 22734
judge, 22735
by 22736
the 22737
way, 22738
was 22739
the 22740
King; 22741
and 22742
as 22743
he 22744
wore 22745
his 22746
crown 22747
over 22748
the 22749
wig, 22750
(look 22751
at 22752
the 22753
frontispiece 22754
if 22755
you 22756
want 22757
to 22758
see 22759
how 22760
he 22761
did 22762
it,) 22763
he 22764
did 22765
not 22766
look 22767
at 22768
all 22769
comfortable, 22770
and 22771
it 22772
was 22773
certainly 22774
not 22775
becoming. 22776
“And 22777
that’s 22778
the 22779
jury-box,” 22780
thought 22781
Alice, 22782
“and 22783
those 22784
twelve 22785
creatures,” 22786
(she 22787
was 22788
obliged 22789
to 22790
say 22791
“creatures,” 22792
you 22793
see, 22794
because 22795
some 22796
of 22797
them 22798
were 22799
animals, 22800
and 22801
some 22802
were 22803
birds,) 22804
“I 22805
suppose 22806
they 22807
are 22808
the 22809
jurors.” 22810
She 22811
said 22812
this 22813
last 22814
word 22815
two 22816
or 22817
three 22818
times 22819
over 22820
to 22821
herself, 22822
being 22823
rather 22824
proud 22825
of 22826
it: 22827
for 22828
she 22829
thought, 22830
and 22831
rightly 22832
too, 22833
that 22834
very 22835
few 22836
little 22837
girls 22838
of 22839
her 22840
age 22841
knew 22842
the 22843
meaning 22844
of 22845
it 22846
at 22847
all. 22848
However, 22849
“jury-men” 22850
would 22851
have 22852
done 22853
just 22854
as 22855
well. 22856
The 22857
twelve 22858
jurors 22859
were 22860
all 22861
writing 22862
very 22863
busily 22864
on 22865
slates. 22866
“What 22867
are 22868
they 22869
doing?” 22870
Alice 22871
whispered 22872
to 22873
the 22874
Gryphon. 22875
“They 22876
can’t 22877
have 22878
anything 22879
to 22880
put 22881
down 22882
yet, 22883
before 22884
the 22885
trial’s 22886
begun.” 22887
“They’re 22888
putting 22889
down 22890
their 22891
names,” 22892
the 22893
Gryphon 22894
whispered 22895
in 22896
reply, 22897
“for 22898
fear 22899
they 22900
should 22901
forget 22902
them 22903
before 22904
the 22905
end 22906
of 22907
the 22908
trial.” 22909
“Stupid 22910
things!” 22911
Alice 22912
began 22913
in 22914
a 22915
loud, 22916
indignant 22917
voice, 22918
but 22919
she 22920
stopped 22921
hastily, 22922
for 22923
the 22924
White 22925
Rabbit 22926
cried 22927
out, 22928
“Silence 22929
in 22930
the 22931
court!” 22932
and 22933
the 22934
King 22935
put 22936
on 22937
his 22938
spectacles 22939
and 22940
looked 22941
anxiously 22942
round, 22943
to 22944
make 22945
out 22946
who 22947
was 22948
talking. 22949
Alice 22950
could 22951
see, 22952
as 22953
well 22954
as 22955
if 22956
she 22957
were 22958
looking 22959
over 22960
their 22961
shoulders, 22962
that 22963
all 22964
the 22965
jurors 22966
were 22967
writing 22968
down 22969
“stupid 22970
things!” 22971
on 22972
their 22973
slates, 22974
and 22975
she 22976
could 22977
even 22978
make 22979
out 22980
that 22981
one 22982
of 22983
them 22984
didn’t 22985
know 22986
how 22987
to 22988
spell 22989
“stupid,” 22990
and 22991
that 22992
he 22993
had 22994
to 22995
ask 22996
his 22997
neighbour 22998
to 22999
tell 23000
him. 23001
“A 23002
nice 23003
muddle 23004
their 23005
slates’ll 23006
be 23007
in 23008
before 23009
the 23010
trial’s 23011
over!” 23012
thought 23013
Alice. 23014
One 23015
of 23016
the 23017
jurors 23018
had 23019
a 23020
pencil 23021
that 23022
squeaked. 23023
This 23024
of 23025
course, 23026
Alice 23027
could 23028
_not_ 23029
stand, 23030
and 23031
she 23032
went 23033
round 23034
the 23035
court 23036
and 23037
got 23038
behind 23039
him, 23040
and 23041
very 23042
soon 23043
found 23044
an 23045
opportunity 23046
of 23047
taking 23048
it 23049
away. 23050
She 23051
did 23052
it 23053
so 23054
quickly 23055
that 23056
the 23057
poor 23058
little 23059
juror 23060
(it 23061
was 23062
Bill, 23063
the 23064
Lizard) 23065
could 23066
not 23067
make 23068
out 23069
at 23070
all 23071
what 23072
had 23073
become 23074
of 23075
it; 23076
so, 23077
after 23078
hunting 23079
all 23080
about 23081
for 23082
it, 23083
he 23084
was 23085
obliged 23086
to 23087
write 23088
with 23089
one 23090
finger 23091
for 23092
the 23093
rest 23094
of 23095
the 23096
day; 23097
and 23098
this 23099
was 23100
of 23101
very 23102
little 23103
use, 23104
as 23105
it 23106
left 23107
no 23108
mark 23109
on 23110
the 23111
slate. 23112
“Herald, 23113
read 23114
the 23115
accusation!” 23116
said 23117
the 23118
King. 23119
On 23120
this 23121
the 23122
White 23123
Rabbit 23124
blew 23125
three 23126
blasts 23127
on 23128
the 23129
trumpet, 23130
and 23131
then 23132
unrolled 23133
the 23134
parchment 23135
scroll, 23136
and 23137
read 23138
as 23139
follows:— 23140
“The 23141
Queen 23142
of 23143
Hearts, 23144
she 23145
made 23146
some 23147
tarts, 23148
All 23149
on 23150
a 23151
summer 23152
day: 23153
The 23154
Knave 23155
of 23156
Hearts, 23157
he 23158
stole 23159
those 23160
tarts, 23161
And 23162
took 23163
them 23164
quite 23165
away!” 23166
“Consider 23167
your 23168
verdict,” 23169
the 23170
King 23171
said 23172
to 23173
the 23174
jury. 23175
“Not 23176
yet, 23177
not 23178
yet!” 23179
the 23180
Rabbit 23181
hastily 23182
interrupted. 23183
“There’s 23184
a 23185
great 23186
deal 23187
to 23188
come 23189
before 23190
that!” 23191
“Call 23192
the 23193
first 23194
witness,” 23195
said 23196
the 23197
King; 23198
and 23199
the 23200
White 23201
Rabbit 23202
blew 23203
three 23204
blasts 23205
on 23206
the 23207
trumpet, 23208
and 23209
called 23210
out, 23211
“First 23212
witness!” 23213
The 23214
first 23215
witness 23216
was 23217
the 23218
Hatter. 23219
He 23220
came 23221
in 23222
with 23223
a 23224
teacup 23225
in 23226
one 23227
hand 23228
and 23229
a 23230
piece 23231
of 23232
bread-and-butter 23233
in 23234
the 23235
other. 23236
“I 23237
beg 23238
pardon, 23239
your 23240
Majesty,” 23241
he 23242
began, 23243
“for 23244
bringing 23245
these 23246
in: 23247
but 23248
I 23249
hadn’t 23250
quite 23251
finished 23252
my 23253
tea 23254
when 23255
I 23256
was 23257
sent 23258
for.” 23259
“You 23260
ought 23261
to 23262
have 23263
finished,” 23264
said 23265
the 23266
King. 23267
“When 23268
did 23269
you 23270
begin?” 23271
The 23272
Hatter 23273
looked 23274
at 23275
the 23276
March 23277
Hare, 23278
who 23279
had 23280
followed 23281
him 23282
into 23283
the 23284
court, 23285
arm-in-arm 23286
with 23287
the 23288
Dormouse. 23289
“Fourteenth 23290
of 23291
March, 23292
I 23293
_think_ 23294
it 23295
was,” 23296
he 23297
said. 23298
“Fifteenth,” 23299
said 23300
the 23301
March 23302
Hare. 23303
“Sixteenth,” 23304
added 23305
the 23306
Dormouse. 23307
“Write 23308
that 23309
down,” 23310
the 23311
King 23312
said 23313
to 23314
the 23315
jury, 23316
and 23317
the 23318
jury 23319
eagerly 23320
wrote 23321
down 23322
all 23323
three 23324
dates 23325
on 23326
their 23327
slates, 23328
and 23329
then 23330
added 23331
them 23332
up, 23333
and 23334
reduced 23335
the 23336
answer 23337
to 23338
shillings 23339
and 23340
pence. 23341
“Take 23342
off 23343
your 23344
hat,” 23345
the 23346
King 23347
said 23348
to 23349
the 23350
Hatter. 23351
“It 23352
isn’t 23353
mine,” 23354
said 23355
the 23356
Hatter. 23357
“_Stolen!_” 23358
the 23359
King 23360
exclaimed, 23361
turning 23362
to 23363
the 23364
jury, 23365
who 23366
instantly 23367
made 23368
a 23369
memorandum 23370
of 23371
the 23372
fact. 23373
“I 23374
keep 23375
them 23376
to 23377
sell,” 23378
the 23379
Hatter 23380
added 23381
as 23382
an 23383
explanation; 23384
“I’ve 23385
none 23386
of 23387
my 23388
own. 23389
I’m 23390
a 23391
hatter.” 23392
Here 23393
the 23394
Queen 23395
put 23396
on 23397
her 23398
spectacles, 23399
and 23400
began 23401
staring 23402
at 23403
the 23404
Hatter, 23405
who 23406
turned 23407
pale 23408
and 23409
fidgeted. 23410
“Give 23411
your 23412
evidence,” 23413
said 23414
the 23415
King; 23416
“and 23417
don’t 23418
be 23419
nervous, 23420
or 23421
I’ll 23422
have 23423
you 23424
executed 23425
on 23426
the 23427
spot.” 23428
This 23429
did 23430
not 23431
seem 23432
to 23433
encourage 23434
the 23435
witness 23436
at 23437
all: 23438
he 23439
kept 23440
shifting 23441
from 23442
one 23443
foot 23444
to 23445
the 23446
other, 23447
looking 23448
uneasily 23449
at 23450
the 23451
Queen, 23452
and 23453
in 23454
his 23455
confusion 23456
he 23457
bit 23458
a 23459
large 23460
piece 23461
out 23462
of 23463
his 23464
teacup 23465
instead 23466
of 23467
the 23468
bread-and-butter. 23469
Just 23470
at 23471
this 23472
moment 23473
Alice 23474
felt 23475
a 23476
very 23477
curious 23478
sensation, 23479
which 23480
puzzled 23481
her 23482
a 23483
good 23484
deal 23485
until 23486
she 23487
made 23488
out 23489
what 23490
it 23491
was: 23492
she 23493
was 23494
beginning 23495
to 23496
grow 23497
larger 23498
again, 23499
and 23500
she 23501
thought 23502
at 23503
first 23504
she 23505
would 23506
get 23507
up 23508
and 23509
leave 23510
the 23511
court; 23512
but 23513
on 23514
second 23515
thoughts 23516
she 23517
decided 23518
to 23519
remain 23520
where 23521
she 23522
was 23523
as 23524
long 23525
as 23526
there 23527
was 23528
room 23529
for 23530
her. 23531
“I 23532
wish 23533
you 23534
wouldn’t 23535
squeeze 23536
so.” 23537
said 23538
the 23539
Dormouse, 23540
who 23541
was 23542
sitting 23543
next 23544
to 23545
her. 23546
“I 23547
can 23548
hardly 23549
breathe.” 23550
“I 23551
can’t 23552
help 23553
it,” 23554
said 23555
Alice 23556
very 23557
meekly: 23558
“I’m 23559
growing.” 23560
“You’ve 23561
no 23562
right 23563
to 23564
grow 23565
_here_,” 23566
said 23567
the 23568
Dormouse. 23569
“Don’t 23570
talk 23571
nonsense,” 23572
said 23573
Alice 23574
more 23575
boldly: 23576
“you 23577
know 23578
you’re 23579
growing 23580
too.” 23581
“Yes, 23582
but 23583
_I_ 23584
grow 23585
at 23586
a 23587
reasonable 23588
pace,” 23589
said 23590
the 23591
Dormouse: 23592
“not 23593
in 23594
that 23595
ridiculous 23596
fashion.” 23597
And 23598
he 23599
got 23600
up 23601
very 23602
sulkily 23603
and 23604
crossed 23605
over 23606
to 23607
the 23608
other 23609
side 23610
of 23611
the 23612
court. 23613
All 23614
this 23615
time 23616
the 23617
Queen 23618
had 23619
never 23620
left 23621
off 23622
staring 23623
at 23624
the 23625
Hatter, 23626
and, 23627
just 23628
as 23629
the 23630
Dormouse 23631
crossed 23632
the 23633
court, 23634
she 23635
said 23636
to 23637
one 23638
of 23639
the 23640
officers 23641
of 23642
the 23643
court, 23644
“Bring 23645
me 23646
the 23647
list 23648
of 23649
the 23650
singers 23651
in 23652
the 23653
last 23654
concert!” 23655
on 23656
which 23657
the 23658
wretched 23659
Hatter 23660
trembled 23661
so, 23662
that 23663
he 23664
shook 23665
both 23666
his 23667
shoes 23668
off. 23669
“Give 23670
your 23671
evidence,” 23672
the 23673
King 23674
repeated 23675
angrily, 23676
“or 23677
I’ll 23678
have 23679
you 23680
executed, 23681
whether 23682
you’re 23683
nervous 23684
or 23685
not.” 23686
“I’m 23687
a 23688
poor 23689
man, 23690
your 23691
Majesty,” 23692
the 23693
Hatter 23694
began, 23695
in 23696
a 23697
trembling 23698
voice, 23699
“—and 23700
I 23701
hadn’t 23702
begun 23703
my 23704
tea—not 23705
above 23706
a 23707
week 23708
or 23709
so—and 23710
what 23711
with 23712
the 23713
bread-and-butter 23714
getting 23715
so 23716
thin—and 23717
the 23718
twinkling 23719
of 23720
the 23721
tea—” 23722
“The 23723
twinkling 23724
of 23725
the 23726
_what?_” 23727
said 23728
the 23729
King. 23730
“It 23731
_began_ 23732
with 23733
the 23734
tea,” 23735
the 23736
Hatter 23737
replied. 23738
“Of 23739
course 23740
twinkling 23741
begins 23742
with 23743
a 23744
T!” 23745
said 23746
the 23747
King 23748
sharply. 23749
“Do 23750
you 23751
take 23752
me 23753
for 23754
a 23755
dunce? 23756
Go 23757
on!” 23758
“I’m 23759
a 23760
poor 23761
man,” 23762
the 23763
Hatter 23764
went 23765
on, 23766
“and 23767
most 23768
things 23769
twinkled 23770
after 23771
that—only 23772
the 23773
March 23774
Hare 23775
said—” 23776
“I 23777
didn’t!” 23778
the 23779
March 23780
Hare 23781
interrupted 23782
in 23783
a 23784
great 23785
hurry. 23786
“You 23787
did!” 23788
said 23789
the 23790
Hatter. 23791
“I 23792
deny 23793
it!” 23794
said 23795
the 23796
March 23797
Hare. 23798
“He 23799
denies 23800
it,” 23801
said 23802
the 23803
King: 23804
“leave 23805
out 23806
that 23807
part.” 23808
“Well, 23809
at 23810
any 23811
rate, 23812
the 23813
Dormouse 23814
said—” 23815
the 23816
Hatter 23817
went 23818
on, 23819
looking 23820
anxiously 23821
round 23822
to 23823
see 23824
if 23825
he 23826
would 23827
deny 23828
it 23829
too: 23830
but 23831
the 23832
Dormouse 23833
denied 23834
nothing, 23835
being 23836
fast 23837
asleep. 23838
“After 23839
that,” 23840
continued 23841
the 23842
Hatter, 23843
“I 23844
cut 23845
some 23846
more 23847
bread-and-butter—” 23848
“But 23849
what 23850
did 23851
the 23852
Dormouse 23853
say?” 23854
one 23855
of 23856
the 23857
jury 23858
asked. 23859
“That 23860
I 23861
can’t 23862
remember,” 23863
said 23864
the 23865
Hatter. 23866
“You 23867
_must_ 23868
remember,” 23869
remarked 23870
the 23871
King, 23872
“or 23873
I’ll 23874
have 23875
you 23876
executed.” 23877
The 23878
miserable 23879
Hatter 23880
dropped 23881
his 23882
teacup 23883
and 23884
bread-and-butter, 23885
and 23886
went 23887
down 23888
on 23889
one 23890
knee. 23891
“I’m 23892
a 23893
poor 23894
man, 23895
your 23896
Majesty,” 23897
he 23898
began. 23899
“You’re 23900
a 23901
_very_ 23902
poor 23903
_speaker_,” 23904
said 23905
the 23906
King. 23907
Here 23908
one 23909
of 23910
the 23911
guinea-pigs 23912
cheered, 23913
and 23914
was 23915
immediately 23916
suppressed 23917
by 23918
the 23919
officers 23920
of 23921
the 23922
court. 23923
(As 23924
that 23925
is 23926
rather 23927
a 23928
hard 23929
word, 23930
I 23931
will 23932
just 23933
explain 23934
to 23935
you 23936
how 23937
it 23938
was 23939
done. 23940
They 23941
had 23942
a 23943
large 23944
canvas 23945
bag, 23946
which 23947
tied 23948
up 23949
at 23950
the 23951
mouth 23952
with 23953
strings: 23954
into 23955
this 23956
they 23957
slipped 23958
the 23959
guinea-pig, 23960
head 23961
first, 23962
and 23963
then 23964
sat 23965
upon 23966
it.) 23967
“I’m 23968
glad 23969
I’ve 23970
seen 23971
that 23972
done,” 23973
thought 23974
Alice. 23975
“I’ve 23976
so 23977
often 23978
read 23979
in 23980
the 23981
newspapers, 23982
at 23983
the 23984
end 23985
of 23986
trials, 23987
“There 23988
was 23989
some 23990
attempts 23991
at 23992
applause, 23993
which 23994
was 23995
immediately 23996
suppressed 23997
by 23998
the 23999
officers 24000
of 24001
the 24002
court,” 24003
and 24004
I 24005
never 24006
understood 24007
what 24008
it 24009
meant 24010
till 24011
now.” 24012
“If 24013
that’s 24014
all 24015
you 24016
know 24017
about 24018
it, 24019
you 24020
may 24021
stand 24022
down,” 24023
continued 24024
the 24025
King. 24026
“I 24027
can’t 24028
go 24029
no 24030
lower,” 24031
said 24032
the 24033
Hatter: 24034
“I’m 24035
on 24036
the 24037
floor, 24038
as 24039
it 24040
is.” 24041
“Then 24042
you 24043
may 24044
_sit_ 24045
down,” 24046
the 24047
King 24048
replied. 24049
Here 24050
the 24051
other 24052
guinea-pig 24053
cheered, 24054
and 24055
was 24056
suppressed. 24057
“Come, 24058
that 24059
finished 24060
the 24061
guinea-pigs!” 24062
thought 24063
Alice. 24064
“Now 24065
we 24066
shall 24067
get 24068
on 24069
better.” 24070
“I’d 24071
rather 24072
finish 24073
my 24074
tea,” 24075
said 24076
the 24077
Hatter, 24078
with 24079
an 24080
anxious 24081
look 24082
at 24083
the 24084
Queen, 24085
who 24086
was 24087
reading 24088
the 24089
list 24090
of 24091
singers. 24092
“You 24093
may 24094
go,” 24095
said 24096
the 24097
King, 24098
and 24099
the 24100
Hatter 24101
hurriedly 24102
left 24103
the 24104
court, 24105
without 24106
even 24107
waiting 24108
to 24109
put 24110
his 24111
shoes 24112
on. 24113
“—and 24114
just 24115
take 24116
his 24117
head 24118
off 24119
outside,” 24120
the 24121
Queen 24122
added 24123
to 24124
one 24125
of 24126
the 24127
officers: 24128
but 24129
the 24130
Hatter 24131
was 24132
out 24133
of 24134
sight 24135
before 24136
the 24137
officer 24138
could 24139
get 24140
to 24141
the 24142
door. 24143
“Call 24144
the 24145
next 24146
witness!” 24147
said 24148
the 24149
King. 24150
The 24151
next 24152
witness 24153
was 24154
the 24155
Duchess’s 24156
cook. 24157
She 24158
carried 24159
the 24160
pepper-box 24161
in 24162
her 24163
hand, 24164
and 24165
Alice 24166
guessed 24167
who 24168
it 24169
was, 24170
even 24171
before 24172
she 24173
got 24174
into 24175
the 24176
court, 24177
by 24178
the 24179
way 24180
the 24181
people 24182
near 24183
the 24184
door 24185
began 24186
sneezing 24187
all 24188
at 24189
once. 24190
“Give 24191
your 24192
evidence,” 24193
said 24194
the 24195
King. 24196
“Shan’t,” 24197
said 24198
the 24199
cook. 24200
The 24201
King 24202
looked 24203
anxiously 24204
at 24205
the 24206
White 24207
Rabbit, 24208
who 24209
said 24210
in 24211
a 24212
low 24213
voice, 24214
“Your 24215
Majesty 24216
must 24217
cross-examine 24218
_this_ 24219
witness.” 24220
“Well, 24221
if 24222
I 24223
must, 24224
I 24225
must,” 24226
the 24227
King 24228
said, 24229
with 24230
a 24231
melancholy 24232
air, 24233
and, 24234
after 24235
folding 24236
his 24237
arms 24238
and 24239
frowning 24240
at 24241
the 24242
cook 24243
till 24244
his 24245
eyes 24246
were 24247
nearly 24248
out 24249
of 24250
sight, 24251
he 24252
said 24253
in 24254
a 24255
deep 24256
voice, 24257
“What 24258
are 24259
tarts 24260
made 24261
of?” 24262
“Pepper, 24263
mostly,” 24264
said 24265
the 24266
cook. 24267
“Treacle,” 24268
said 24269
a 24270
sleepy 24271
voice 24272
behind 24273
her. 24274
“Collar 24275
that 24276
Dormouse,” 24277
the 24278
Queen 24279
shrieked 24280
out. 24281
“Behead 24282
that 24283
Dormouse! 24284
Turn 24285
that 24286
Dormouse 24287
out 24288
of 24289
court! 24290
Suppress 24291
him! 24292
Pinch 24293
him! 24294
Off 24295
with 24296
his 24297
whiskers!” 24298
For 24299
some 24300
minutes 24301
the 24302
whole 24303
court 24304
was 24305
in 24306
confusion, 24307
getting 24308
the 24309
Dormouse 24310
turned 24311
out, 24312
and, 24313
by 24314
the 24315
time 24316
they 24317
had 24318
settled 24319
down 24320
again, 24321
the 24322
cook 24323
had 24324
disappeared. 24325
“Never 24326
mind!” 24327
said 24328
the 24329
King, 24330
with 24331
an 24332
air 24333
of 24334
great 24335
relief. 24336
“Call 24337
the 24338
next 24339
witness.” 24340
And 24341
he 24342
added 24343
in 24344
an 24345
undertone 24346
to 24347
the 24348
Queen, 24349
“Really, 24350
my 24351
dear, 24352
_you_ 24353
must 24354
cross-examine 24355
the 24356
next 24357
witness. 24358
It 24359
quite 24360
makes 24361
my 24362
forehead 24363
ache!” 24364
Alice 24365
watched 24366
the 24367
White 24368
Rabbit 24369
as 24370
he 24371
fumbled 24372
over 24373
the 24374
list, 24375
feeling 24376
very 24377
curious 24378
to 24379
see 24380
what 24381
the 24382
next 24383
witness 24384
would 24385
be 24386
like, 24387
“—for 24388
they 24389
haven’t 24390
got 24391
much 24392
evidence 24393
_yet_,” 24394
she 24395
said 24396
to 24397
herself. 24398
Imagine 24399
her 24400
surprise, 24401
when 24402
the 24403
White 24404
Rabbit 24405
read 24406
out, 24407
at 24408
the 24409
top 24410
of 24411
his 24412
shrill 24413
little 24414
voice, 24415
the 24416
name 24417
“Alice!” 24418
CHAPTER 24419
XII. 24420
Alice’s 24421
Evidence 24422
“Here!” 24423
cried 24424
Alice, 24425
quite 24426
forgetting 24427
in 24428
the 24429
flurry 24430
of 24431
the 24432
moment 24433
how 24434
large 24435
she 24436
had 24437
grown 24438
in 24439
the 24440
last 24441
few 24442
minutes, 24443
and 24444
she 24445
jumped 24446
up 24447
in 24448
such 24449
a 24450
hurry 24451
that 24452
she 24453
tipped 24454
over 24455
the 24456
jury-box 24457
with 24458
the 24459
edge 24460
of 24461
her 24462
skirt, 24463
upsetting 24464
all 24465
the 24466
jurymen 24467
on 24468
to 24469
the 24470
heads 24471
of 24472
the 24473
crowd 24474
below, 24475
and 24476
there 24477
they 24478
lay 24479
sprawling 24480
about, 24481
reminding 24482
her 24483
very 24484
much 24485
of 24486
a 24487
globe 24488
of 24489
goldfish 24490
she 24491
had 24492
accidentally 24493
upset 24494
the 24495
week 24496
before. 24497
“Oh, 24498
I 24499
_beg_ 24500
your 24501
pardon!” 24502
she 24503
exclaimed 24504
in 24505
a 24506
tone 24507
of 24508
great 24509
dismay, 24510
and 24511
began 24512
picking 24513
them 24514
up 24515
again 24516
as 24517
quickly 24518
as 24519
she 24520
could, 24521
for 24522
the 24523
accident 24524
of 24525
the 24526
goldfish 24527
kept 24528
running 24529
in 24530
her 24531
head, 24532
and 24533
she 24534
had 24535
a 24536
vague 24537
sort 24538
of 24539
idea 24540
that 24541
they 24542
must 24543
be 24544
collected 24545
at 24546
once 24547
and 24548
put 24549
back 24550
into 24551
the 24552
jury-box, 24553
or 24554
they 24555
would 24556
die. 24557
“The 24558
trial 24559
cannot 24560
proceed,” 24561
said 24562
the 24563
King 24564
in 24565
a 24566
very 24567
grave 24568
voice, 24569
“until 24570
all 24571
the 24572
jurymen 24573
are 24574
back 24575
in 24576
their 24577
proper 24578
places—_all_,” 24579
he 24580
repeated 24581
with 24582
great 24583
emphasis, 24584
looking 24585
hard 24586
at 24587
Alice 24588
as 24589
he 24590
said 24591
so. 24592
Alice 24593
looked 24594
at 24595
the 24596
jury-box, 24597
and 24598
saw 24599
that, 24600
in 24601
her 24602
haste, 24603
she 24604
had 24605
put 24606
the 24607
Lizard 24608
in 24609
head 24610
downwards, 24611
and 24612
the 24613
poor 24614
little 24615
thing 24616
was 24617
waving 24618
its 24619
tail 24620
about 24621
in 24622
a 24623
melancholy 24624
way, 24625
being 24626
quite 24627
unable 24628
to 24629
move. 24630
She 24631
soon 24632
got 24633
it 24634
out 24635
again, 24636
and 24637
put 24638
it 24639
right; 24640
“not 24641
that 24642
it 24643
signifies 24644
much,” 24645
she 24646
said 24647
to 24648
herself; 24649
“I 24650
should 24651
think 24652
it 24653
would 24654
be 24655
_quite_ 24656
as 24657
much 24658
use 24659
in 24660
the 24661
trial 24662
one 24663
way 24664
up 24665
as 24666
the 24667
other.” 24668
As 24669
soon 24670
as 24671
the 24672
jury 24673
had 24674
a 24675
little 24676
recovered 24677
from 24678
the 24679
shock 24680
of 24681
being 24682
upset, 24683
and 24684
their 24685
slates 24686
and 24687
pencils 24688
had 24689
been 24690
found 24691
and 24692
handed 24693
back 24694
to 24695
them, 24696
they 24697
set 24698
to 24699
work 24700
very 24701
diligently 24702
to 24703
write 24704
out 24705
a 24706
history 24707
of 24708
the 24709
accident, 24710
all 24711
except 24712
the 24713
Lizard, 24714
who 24715
seemed 24716
too 24717
much 24718
overcome 24719
to 24720
do 24721
anything 24722
but 24723
sit 24724
with 24725
its 24726
mouth 24727
open, 24728
gazing 24729
up 24730
into 24731
the 24732
roof 24733
of 24734
the 24735
court. 24736
“What 24737
do 24738
you 24739
know 24740
about 24741
this 24742
business?” 24743
the 24744
King 24745
said 24746
to 24747
Alice. 24748
“Nothing,” 24749
said 24750
Alice. 24751
“Nothing 24752
_whatever?_” 24753
persisted 24754
the 24755
King. 24756
“Nothing 24757
whatever,” 24758
said 24759
Alice. 24760
“That’s 24761
very 24762
important,” 24763
the 24764
King 24765
said, 24766
turning 24767
to 24768
the 24769
jury. 24770
They 24771
were 24772
just 24773
beginning 24774
to 24775
write 24776
this 24777
down 24778
on 24779
their 24780
slates, 24781
when 24782
the 24783
White 24784
Rabbit 24785
interrupted: 24786
“_Un_important, 24787
your 24788
Majesty 24789
means, 24790
of 24791
course,” 24792
he 24793
said 24794
in 24795
a 24796
very 24797
respectful 24798
tone, 24799
but 24800
frowning 24801
and 24802
making 24803
faces 24804
at 24805
him 24806
as 24807
he 24808
spoke. 24809
“_Un_important, 24810
of 24811
course, 24812
I 24813
meant,” 24814
the 24815
King 24816
hastily 24817
said, 24818
and 24819
went 24820
on 24821
to 24822
himself 24823
in 24824
an 24825
undertone, 24826
“important—unimportant—unimportant—important—” 24827
as 24828
if 24829
he 24830
were 24831
trying 24832
which 24833
word 24834
sounded 24835
best. 24836
Some 24837
of 24838
the 24839
jury 24840
wrote 24841
it 24842
down 24843
“important,” 24844
and 24845
some 24846
“unimportant.” 24847
Alice 24848
could 24849
see 24850
this, 24851
as 24852
she 24853
was 24854
near 24855
enough 24856
to 24857
look 24858
over 24859
their 24860
slates; 24861
“but 24862
it 24863
doesn’t 24864
matter 24865
a 24866
bit,” 24867
she 24868
thought 24869
to 24870
herself. 24871
At 24872
this 24873
moment 24874
the 24875
King, 24876
who 24877
had 24878
been 24879
for 24880
some 24881
time 24882
busily 24883
writing 24884
in 24885
his 24886
note-book, 24887
cackled 24888
out 24889
“Silence!” 24890
and 24891
read 24892
out 24893
from 24894
his 24895
book, 24896
“Rule 24897
Forty-two. 24898
_All 24899
persons 24900
more 24901
than 24902
a 24903
mile 24904
high 24905
to 24906
leave 24907
the 24908
court_.” 24909
Everybody 24910
looked 24911
at 24912
Alice. 24913
“_I’m_ 24914
not 24915
a 24916
mile 24917
high,” 24918
said 24919
Alice. 24920
“You 24921
are,” 24922
said 24923
the 24924
King. 24925
“Nearly 24926
two 24927
miles 24928
high,” 24929
added 24930
the 24931
Queen. 24932
“Well, 24933
I 24934
shan’t 24935
go, 24936
at 24937
any 24938
rate,” 24939
said 24940
Alice: 24941
“besides, 24942
that’s 24943
not 24944
a 24945
regular 24946
rule: 24947
you 24948
invented 24949
it 24950
just 24951
now.” 24952
“It’s 24953
the 24954
oldest 24955
rule 24956
in 24957
the 24958
book,” 24959
said 24960
the 24961
King. 24962
“Then 24963
it 24964
ought 24965
to 24966
be 24967
Number 24968
One,” 24969
said 24970
Alice. 24971
The 24972
King 24973
turned 24974
pale, 24975
and 24976
shut 24977
his 24978
note-book 24979
hastily. 24980
“Consider 24981
your 24982
verdict,” 24983
he 24984
said 24985
to 24986
the 24987
jury, 24988
in 24989
a 24990
low, 24991
trembling 24992
voice. 24993
“There’s 24994
more 24995
evidence 24996
to 24997
come 24998
yet, 24999
please 25000
your 25001
Majesty,” 25002
said 25003
the 25004
White 25005
Rabbit, 25006
jumping 25007
up 25008
in 25009
a 25010
great 25011
hurry; 25012
“this 25013
paper 25014
has 25015
just 25016
been 25017
picked 25018
up.” 25019
“What’s 25020
in 25021
it?” 25022
said 25023
the 25024
Queen. 25025
“I 25026
haven’t 25027
opened 25028
it 25029
yet,” 25030
said 25031
the 25032
White 25033
Rabbit, 25034
“but 25035
it 25036
seems 25037
to 25038
be 25039
a 25040
letter, 25041
written 25042
by 25043
the 25044
prisoner 25045
to—to 25046
somebody.” 25047
“It 25048
must 25049
have 25050
been 25051
that,” 25052
said 25053
the 25054
King, 25055
“unless 25056
it 25057
was 25058
written 25059
to 25060
nobody, 25061
which 25062
isn’t 25063
usual, 25064
you 25065
know.” 25066
“Who 25067
is 25068
it 25069
directed 25070
to?” 25071
said 25072
one 25073
of 25074
the 25075
jurymen. 25076
“It 25077
isn’t 25078
directed 25079
at 25080
all,” 25081
said 25082
the 25083
White 25084
Rabbit; 25085
“in 25086
fact, 25087
there’s 25088
nothing 25089
written 25090
on 25091
the 25092
_outside_.” 25093
He 25094
unfolded 25095
the 25096
paper 25097
as 25098
he 25099
spoke, 25100
and 25101
added 25102
“It 25103
isn’t 25104
a 25105
letter, 25106
after 25107
all: 25108
it’s 25109
a 25110
set 25111
of 25112
verses.” 25113
“Are 25114
they 25115
in 25116
the 25117
prisoner’s 25118
handwriting?” 25119
asked 25120
another 25121
of 25122
the 25123
jurymen. 25124
“No, 25125
they’re 25126
not,” 25127
said 25128
the 25129
White 25130
Rabbit, 25131
“and 25132
that’s 25133
the 25134
queerest 25135
thing 25136
about 25137
it.” 25138
(The 25139
jury 25140
all 25141
looked 25142
puzzled.) 25143
“He 25144
must 25145
have 25146
imitated 25147
somebody 25148
else’s 25149
hand,” 25150
said 25151
the 25152
King. 25153
(The 25154
jury 25155
all 25156
brightened 25157
up 25158
again.) 25159
“Please 25160
your 25161
Majesty,” 25162
said 25163
the 25164
Knave, 25165
“I 25166
didn’t 25167
write 25168
it, 25169
and 25170
they 25171
can’t 25172
prove 25173
I 25174
did: 25175
there’s 25176
no 25177
name 25178
signed 25179
at 25180
the 25181
end.” 25182
“If 25183
you 25184
didn’t 25185
sign 25186
it,” 25187
said 25188
the 25189
King, 25190
“that 25191
only 25192
makes 25193
the 25194
matter 25195
worse. 25196
You 25197
_must_ 25198
have 25199
meant 25200
some 25201
mischief, 25202
or 25203
else 25204
you’d 25205
have 25206
signed 25207
your 25208
name 25209
like 25210
an 25211
honest 25212
man.” 25213
There 25214
was 25215
a 25216
general 25217
clapping 25218
of 25219
hands 25220
at 25221
this: 25222
it 25223
was 25224
the 25225
first 25226
really 25227
clever 25228
thing 25229
the 25230
King 25231
had 25232
said 25233
that 25234
day. 25235
“That 25236
_proves_ 25237
his 25238
guilt,” 25239
said 25240
the 25241
Queen. 25242
“It 25243
proves 25244
nothing 25245
of 25246
the 25247
sort!” 25248
said 25249
Alice. 25250
“Why, 25251
you 25252
don’t 25253
even 25254
know 25255
what 25256
they’re 25257
about!” 25258
“Read 25259
them,” 25260
said 25261
the 25262
King. 25263
The 25264
White 25265
Rabbit 25266
put 25267
on 25268
his 25269
spectacles. 25270
“Where 25271
shall 25272
I 25273
begin, 25274
please 25275
your 25276
Majesty?” 25277
he 25278
asked. 25279
“Begin 25280
at 25281
the 25282
beginning,” 25283
the 25284
King 25285
said 25286
gravely, 25287
“and 25288
go 25289
on 25290
till 25291
you 25292
come 25293
to 25294
the 25295
end: 25296
then 25297
stop.” 25298
These 25299
were 25300
the 25301
verses 25302
the 25303
White 25304
Rabbit 25305
read:— 25306
“They 25307
told 25308
me 25309
you 25310
had 25311
been 25312
to 25313
her, 25314
And 25315
mentioned 25316
me 25317
to 25318
him: 25319
She 25320
gave 25321
me 25322
a 25323
good 25324
character, 25325
But 25326
said 25327
I 25328
could 25329
not 25330
swim. 25331
He 25332
sent 25333
them 25334
word 25335
I 25336
had 25337
not 25338
gone 25339
(We 25340
know 25341
it 25342
to 25343
be 25344
true): 25345
If 25346
she 25347
should 25348
push 25349
the 25350
matter 25351
on, 25352
What 25353
would 25354
become 25355
of 25356
you? 25357
I 25358
gave 25359
her 25360
one, 25361
they 25362
gave 25363
him 25364
two, 25365
You 25366
gave 25367
us 25368
three 25369
or 25370
more; 25371
They 25372
all 25373
returned 25374
from 25375
him 25376
to 25377
you, 25378
Though 25379
they 25380
were 25381
mine 25382
before. 25383
If 25384
I 25385
or 25386
she 25387
should 25388
chance 25389
to 25390
be 25391
Involved 25392
in 25393
this 25394
affair, 25395
He 25396
trusts 25397
to 25398
you 25399
to 25400
set 25401
them 25402
free, 25403
Exactly 25404
as 25405
we 25406
were. 25407
My 25408
notion 25409
was 25410
that 25411
you 25412
had 25413
been 25414
(Before 25415
she 25416
had 25417
this 25418
fit) 25419
An 25420
obstacle 25421
that 25422
came 25423
between 25424
Him, 25425
and 25426
ourselves, 25427
and 25428
it. 25429
Don’t 25430
let 25431
him 25432
know 25433
she 25434
liked 25435
them 25436
best, 25437
For 25438
this 25439
must 25440
ever 25441
be 25442
A 25443
secret, 25444
kept 25445
from 25446
all 25447
the 25448
rest, 25449
Between 25450
yourself 25451
and 25452
me.” 25453
“That’s 25454
the 25455
most 25456
important 25457
piece 25458
of 25459
evidence 25460
we’ve 25461
heard 25462
yet,” 25463
said 25464
the 25465
King, 25466
rubbing 25467
his 25468
hands; 25469
“so 25470
now 25471
let 25472
the 25473
jury—” 25474
“If 25475
any 25476
one 25477
of 25478
them 25479
can 25480
explain 25481
it,” 25482
said 25483
Alice, 25484
(she 25485
had 25486
grown 25487
so 25488
large 25489
in 25490
the 25491
last 25492
few 25493
minutes 25494
that 25495
she 25496
wasn’t 25497
a 25498
bit 25499
afraid 25500
of 25501
interrupting 25502
him,) 25503
“I’ll 25504
give 25505
him 25506
sixpence. 25507
_I_ 25508
don’t 25509
believe 25510
there’s 25511
an 25512
atom 25513
of 25514
meaning 25515
in 25516
it.” 25517
The 25518
jury 25519
all 25520
wrote 25521
down 25522
on 25523
their 25524
slates, 25525
“_She_ 25526
doesn’t 25527
believe 25528
there’s 25529
an 25530
atom 25531
of 25532
meaning 25533
in 25534
it,” 25535
but 25536
none 25537
of 25538
them 25539
attempted 25540
to 25541
explain 25542
the 25543
paper. 25544
“If 25545
there’s 25546
no 25547
meaning 25548
in 25549
it,” 25550
said 25551
the 25552
King, 25553
“that 25554
saves 25555
a 25556
world 25557
of 25558
trouble, 25559
you 25560
know, 25561
as 25562
we 25563
needn’t 25564
try 25565
to 25566
find 25567
any. 25568
And 25569
yet 25570
I 25571
don’t 25572
know,” 25573
he 25574
went 25575
on, 25576
spreading 25577
out 25578
the 25579
verses 25580
on 25581
his 25582
knee, 25583
and 25584
looking 25585
at 25586
them 25587
with 25588
one 25589
eye; 25590
“I 25591
seem 25592
to 25593
see 25594
some 25595
meaning 25596
in 25597
them, 25598
after 25599
all. 25600
“—_said 25601
I 25602
could 25603
not 25604
swim_—” 25605
you 25606
can’t 25607
swim, 25608
can 25609
you?” 25610
he 25611
added, 25612
turning 25613
to 25614
the 25615
Knave. 25616
The 25617
Knave 25618
shook 25619
his 25620
head 25621
sadly. 25622
“Do 25623
I 25624
look 25625
like 25626
it?” 25627
he 25628
said. 25629
(Which 25630
he 25631
certainly 25632
did 25633
_not_, 25634
being 25635
made 25636
entirely 25637
of 25638
cardboard.) 25639
“All 25640
right, 25641
so 25642
far,” 25643
said 25644
the 25645
King, 25646
and 25647
he 25648
went 25649
on 25650
muttering 25651
over 25652
the 25653
verses 25654
to 25655
himself: 25656
“‘_We 25657
know 25658
it 25659
to 25660
be 25661
true_—’ 25662
that’s 25663
the 25664
jury, 25665
of 25666
course—‘_I 25667
gave 25668
her 25669
one, 25670
they 25671
gave 25672
him 25673
two_—’ 25674
why, 25675
that 25676
must 25677
be 25678
what 25679
he 25680
did 25681
with 25682
the 25683
tarts, 25684
you 25685
know—” 25686
“But, 25687
it 25688
goes 25689
on 25690
‘_they 25691
all 25692
returned 25693
from 25694
him 25695
to 25696
you_,’” 25697
said 25698
Alice. 25699
“Why, 25700
there 25701
they 25702
are!” 25703
said 25704
the 25705
King 25706
triumphantly, 25707
pointing 25708
to 25709
the 25710
tarts 25711
on 25712
the 25713
table. 25714
“Nothing 25715
can 25716
be 25717
clearer 25718
than 25719
_that_. 25720
Then 25721
again—‘_before 25722
she 25723
had 25724
this 25725
fit_—’ 25726
you 25727
never 25728
had 25729
fits, 25730
my 25731
dear, 25732
I 25733
think?” 25734
he 25735
said 25736
to 25737
the 25738
Queen. 25739
“Never!” 25740
said 25741
the 25742
Queen 25743
furiously, 25744
throwing 25745
an 25746
inkstand 25747
at 25748
the 25749
Lizard 25750
as 25751
she 25752
spoke. 25753
(The 25754
unfortunate 25755
little 25756
Bill 25757
had 25758
left 25759
off 25760
writing 25761
on 25762
his 25763
slate 25764
with 25765
one 25766
finger, 25767
as 25768
he 25769
found 25770
it 25771
made 25772
no 25773
mark; 25774
but 25775
he 25776
now 25777
hastily 25778
began 25779
again, 25780
using 25781
the 25782
ink, 25783
that 25784
was 25785
trickling 25786
down 25787
his 25788
face, 25789
as 25790
long 25791
as 25792
it 25793
lasted.) 25794
“Then 25795
the 25796
words 25797
don’t 25798
_fit_ 25799
you,” 25800
said 25801
the 25802
King, 25803
looking 25804
round 25805
the 25806
court 25807
with 25808
a 25809
smile. 25810
There 25811
was 25812
a 25813
dead 25814
silence. 25815
“It’s 25816
a 25817
pun!” 25818
the 25819
King 25820
added 25821
in 25822
an 25823
offended 25824
tone, 25825
and 25826
everybody 25827
laughed, 25828
“Let 25829
the 25830
jury 25831
consider 25832
their 25833
verdict,” 25834
the 25835
King 25836
said, 25837
for 25838
about 25839
the 25840
twentieth 25841
time 25842
that 25843
day. 25844
“No, 25845
no!” 25846
said 25847
the 25848
Queen. 25849
“Sentence 25850
first—verdict 25851
afterwards.” 25852
“Stuff 25853
and 25854
nonsense!” 25855
said 25856
Alice 25857
loudly. 25858
“The 25859
idea 25860
of 25861
having 25862
the 25863
sentence 25864
first!” 25865
“Hold 25866
your 25867
tongue!” 25868
said 25869
the 25870
Queen, 25871
turning 25872
purple. 25873
“I 25874
won’t!” 25875
said 25876
Alice. 25877
“Off 25878
with 25879
her 25880
head!” 25881
the 25882
Queen 25883
shouted 25884
at 25885
the 25886
top 25887
of 25888
her 25889
voice. 25890
Nobody 25891
moved. 25892
“Who 25893
cares 25894
for 25895
you?” 25896
said 25897
Alice, 25898
(she 25899
had 25900
grown 25901
to 25902
her 25903
full 25904
size 25905
by 25906
this 25907
time.) 25908
“You’re 25909
nothing 25910
but 25911
a 25912
pack 25913
of 25914
cards!” 25915
At 25916
this 25917
the 25918
whole 25919
pack 25920
rose 25921
up 25922
into 25923
the 25924
air, 25925
and 25926
came 25927
flying 25928
down 25929
upon 25930
her: 25931
she 25932
gave 25933
a 25934
little 25935
scream, 25936
half 25937
of 25938
fright 25939
and 25940
half 25941
of 25942
anger, 25943
and 25944
tried 25945
to 25946
beat 25947
them 25948
off, 25949
and 25950
found 25951
herself 25952
lying 25953
on 25954
the 25955
bank, 25956
with 25957
her 25958
head 25959
in 25960
the 25961
lap 25962
of 25963
her 25964
sister, 25965
who 25966
was 25967
gently 25968
brushing 25969
away 25970
some 25971
dead 25972
leaves 25973
that 25974
had 25975
fluttered 25976
down 25977
from 25978
the 25979
trees 25980
upon 25981
her 25982
face. 25983
“Wake 25984
up, 25985
Alice 25986
dear!” 25987
said 25988
her 25989
sister; 25990
“Why, 25991
what 25992
a 25993
long 25994
sleep 25995
you’ve 25996
had!” 25997
“Oh, 25998
I’ve 25999
had 26000
such 26001
a 26002
curious 26003
dream!” 26004
said 26005
Alice, 26006
and 26007
she 26008
told 26009
her 26010
sister, 26011
as 26012
well 26013
as 26014
she 26015
could 26016
remember 26017
them, 26018
all 26019
these 26020
strange 26021
Adventures 26022
of 26023
hers 26024
that 26025
you 26026
have 26027
just 26028
been 26029
reading 26030
about; 26031
and 26032
when 26033
she 26034
had 26035
finished, 26036
her 26037
sister 26038
kissed 26039
her, 26040
and 26041
said, 26042
“It 26043
_was_ 26044
a 26045
curious 26046
dream, 26047
dear, 26048
certainly: 26049
but 26050
now 26051
run 26052
in 26053
to 26054
your 26055
tea; 26056
it’s 26057
getting 26058
late.” 26059
So 26060
Alice 26061
got 26062
up 26063
and 26064
ran 26065
off, 26066
thinking 26067
while 26068
she 26069
ran, 26070
as 26071
well 26072
she 26073
might, 26074
what 26075
a 26076
wonderful 26077
dream 26078
it 26079
had 26080
been. 26081
But 26082
her 26083
sister 26084
sat 26085
still 26086
just 26087
as 26088
she 26089
left 26090
her, 26091
leaning 26092
her 26093
head 26094
on 26095
her 26096
hand, 26097
watching 26098
the 26099
setting 26100
sun, 26101
and 26102
thinking 26103
of 26104
little 26105
Alice 26106
and 26107
all 26108
her 26109
wonderful 26110
Adventures, 26111
till 26112
she 26113
too 26114
began 26115
dreaming 26116
after 26117
a 26118
fashion, 26119
and 26120
this 26121
was 26122
her 26123
dream:— 26124
First, 26125
she 26126
dreamed 26127
of 26128
little 26129
Alice 26130
herself, 26131
and 26132
once 26133
again 26134
the 26135
tiny 26136
hands 26137
were 26138
clasped 26139
upon 26140
her 26141
knee, 26142
and 26143
the 26144
bright 26145
eager 26146
eyes 26147
were 26148
looking 26149
up 26150
into 26151
hers—she 26152
could 26153
hear 26154
the 26155
very 26156
tones 26157
of 26158
her 26159
voice, 26160
and 26161
see 26162
that 26163
queer 26164
little 26165
toss 26166
of 26167
her 26168
head 26169
to 26170
keep 26171
back 26172
the 26173
wandering 26174
hair 26175
that 26176
_would_ 26177
always 26178
get 26179
into 26180
her 26181
eyes—and 26182
still 26183
as 26184
she 26185
listened, 26186
or 26187
seemed 26188
to 26189
listen, 26190
the 26191
whole 26192
place 26193
around 26194
her 26195
became 26196
alive 26197
with 26198
the 26199
strange 26200
creatures 26201
of 26202
her 26203
little 26204
sister’s 26205
dream. 26206
The 26207
long 26208
grass 26209
rustled 26210
at 26211
her 26212
feet 26213
as 26214
the 26215
White 26216
Rabbit 26217
hurried 26218
by—the 26219
frightened 26220
Mouse 26221
splashed 26222
his 26223
way 26224
through 26225
the 26226
neighbouring 26227
pool—she 26228
could 26229
hear 26230
the 26231
rattle 26232
of 26233
the 26234
teacups 26235
as 26236
the 26237
March 26238
Hare 26239
and 26240
his 26241
friends 26242
shared 26243
their 26244
never-ending 26245
meal, 26246
and 26247
the 26248
shrill 26249
voice 26250
of 26251
the 26252
Queen 26253
ordering 26254
off 26255
her 26256
unfortunate 26257
guests 26258
to 26259
execution—once 26260
more 26261
the 26262
pig-baby 26263
was 26264
sneezing 26265
on 26266
the 26267
Duchess’s 26268
knee, 26269
while 26270
plates 26271
and 26272
dishes 26273
crashed 26274
around 26275
it—once 26276
more 26277
the 26278
shriek 26279
of 26280
the 26281
Gryphon, 26282
the 26283
squeaking 26284
of 26285
the 26286
Lizard’s 26287
slate-pencil, 26288
and 26289
the 26290
choking 26291
of 26292
the 26293
suppressed 26294
guinea-pigs, 26295
filled 26296
the 26297
air, 26298
mixed 26299
up 26300
with 26301
the 26302
distant 26303
sobs 26304
of 26305
the 26306
miserable 26307
Mock 26308
Turtle. 26309
So 26310
she 26311
sat 26312
on, 26313
with 26314
closed 26315
eyes, 26316
and 26317
half 26318
believed 26319
herself 26320
in 26321
Wonderland, 26322
though 26323
she 26324
knew 26325
she 26326
had 26327
but 26328
to 26329
open 26330
them 26331
again, 26332
and 26333
all 26334
would 26335
change 26336
to 26337
dull 26338
reality—the 26339
grass 26340
would 26341
be 26342
only 26343
rustling 26344
in 26345
the 26346
wind, 26347
and 26348
the 26349
pool 26350
rippling 26351
to 26352
the 26353
waving 26354
of 26355
the 26356
reeds—the 26357
rattling 26358
teacups 26359
would 26360
change 26361
to 26362
tinkling 26363
sheep-bells, 26364
and 26365
the 26366
Queen’s 26367
shrill 26368
cries 26369
to 26370
the 26371
voice 26372
of 26373
the 26374
shepherd 26375
boy—and 26376
the 26377
sneeze 26378
of 26379
the 26380
baby, 26381
the 26382
shriek 26383
of 26384
the 26385
Gryphon, 26386
and 26387
all 26388
the 26389
other 26390
queer 26391
noises, 26392
would 26393
change 26394
(she 26395
knew) 26396
to 26397
the 26398
confused 26399
clamour 26400
of 26401
the 26402
busy 26403
farm-yard—while 26404
the 26405
lowing 26406
of 26407
the 26408
cattle 26409
in 26410
the 26411
distance 26412
would 26413
take 26414
the 26415
place 26416
of 26417
the 26418
Mock 26419
Turtle’s 26420
heavy 26421
sobs. 26422
Lastly, 26423
she 26424
pictured 26425
to 26426
herself 26427
how 26428
this 26429
same 26430
little 26431
sister 26432
of 26433
hers 26434
would, 26435
in 26436
the 26437
after-time, 26438
be 26439
herself 26440
a 26441
grown 26442
woman; 26443
and 26444
how 26445
she 26446
would 26447
keep, 26448
through 26449
all 26450
her 26451
riper 26452
years, 26453
the 26454
simple 26455
and 26456
loving 26457
heart 26458
of 26459
her 26460
childhood: 26461
and 26462
how 26463
she 26464
would 26465
gather 26466
about 26467
her 26468
other 26469
little 26470
children, 26471
and 26472
make 26473
_their_ 26474
eyes 26475
bright 26476
and 26477
eager 26478
with 26479
many 26480
a 26481
strange 26482
tale, 26483
perhaps 26484
even 26485
with 26486
the 26487
dream 26488
of 26489
Wonderland 26490
of 26491
long 26492
ago: 26493
and 26494
how 26495
she 26496
would 26497
feel 26498
with 26499
all 26500
their 26501
simple 26502
sorrows, 26503
and 26504
find 26505
a 26506
pleasure 26507
in 26508
all 26509
their 26510
simple 26511
joys, 26512
remembering 26513
her 26514
own 26515
child-life, 26516
and 26517
the 26518
happy 26519
summer 26520
days. 26521
THE 26522
END 26523
